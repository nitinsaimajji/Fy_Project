"INTERESTING MUSEUM: POORLY LIT, BAD DISPLAY",chow69,"Bhopal, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,12-Nov-18,This museum of the State Government is another good place to start one's tour of the Andamans. The displays are unique and really interesting. It gives one a clear picture of the various tribes of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The display halls are large and adequately spaced. The collection on display is good but the same is displayed in a very shoddy manner. The place is poorly lit and makes one wonder as to why is there so much disinterest in the Government of the State when the state thrives on tourism. Never the less worth a visit.,Nov-18

A good but dull museum,kikibee420,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,09-Nov-18,"The idea behind the museum needs to b appreciated - they have tried to throw light on the various tribes of the Andaman and Nicobar islands and have photos, objects, installations related to the tribes.

An elevator is available for use by 'the physically challenged and senior citizen visitors only'. Restrooms are also available.",Nov-18

Neglected history.,669aditim,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,27-Oct-18,"The Museum was quite pathetic.

Anthro..... what? Oh.. human societies...,mohanmonu99,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,07-Oct-18,"Beautiful details about the tribes and natives of Andaman and Nicobar islands. The museum is a treasure of information. 

No photography, even with mobile phones is allowed which i feel is great. It is highly irritating that many places charge for carrying a camera but people with cell phones just click away in glory and disturb everyone around without paying a penny. 

It has to be improved a lot and I would recommend an audio guide to explain all the artifacts so that the interest remains till the end. 

A small tip to the staff, please refrain from keeping modern day articles and utensils along with the displayed artifacts, it gives a very wrong impression More",Oct-18

The exhibits are not very good though and I'd say that the Nicobari exhibits are significantly better than the ones related to the Andamans, which is a shame given the location. 

Photography is not permitted in the museum, and they ask you to check your camera at the desk if you have one. I can't imagine why they disallow photography here, but honestly, there probably isn't much you'd want to photograph anyway.",Aug-18

Quaint - but worth a visit,g747,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,10-Mar-18,This museum perhaps rather appropriately seems stuck in time with displays in old cabinets and rather primitive information diagrams.

At the end it elaborates a little bit more about indigenous tribes of the region.

These chosen items show the modern world that you might have developed delicate products of ourselves but still we were the rough sketches of human imaginations. These things surely make you think of the survival instincts, within the jungle, and resourcefulness of humans with such limited resources. 

3rd floor is mainly about pictures and images taken by professional photographers who were acquainted with some of the tribes. In addition, there is a room dedicated to people who came as a prisoners of war here, and finally settled here with their families for forever to give new identity or society to A&N Islands. 

Anthropological museum is located on Middle Point, it was closest sightseeing to our hotel, blue sea, and so we walked up to the place. It is quite close to Hotel Shompen. Other important places near to museum are Ananda, & Annapurna restaurants which are quite popular eating joints in the area. You can simply walk to these restaurants, from the Museum, to have delicious lunch. 

The Museum remains open from morning 9AM till evening 5PM. However ticket counter and souvenir shop remains open till 4PM only. Museum remains closed on Monday and Government Holidays. Currently, as of Mar 29 2017, ticket costs INR 40/- only. 

If you are history enthusiastic, you are going to take 3.5-4 hours to cover the complete museum, however it would surely take 2 hours of your time even at normal pace. The place can be skipped only if history does not entice you and knowing tribal world attracts you. A&N islands is just a best place to swim in the ocean. 

Please note that you cannot use any camera, any camera and mobile phone camera, within the museum. You would need to hand over your camera at reception. However you can carry your mobile phone, but you must not use it to take the photographs. More",Apr-17

While the tribes are of Mongoloid or African descent, anthropologists are still researching how such differing origins came together on these islands. The Sentinelese have managed to resist contact from the mainstream population, while few others like the Jarawas are now being left alone to protect them from extinction. The Nicobarese have been absorbed into the mainstream after being converted to Christianity by early British settlers, and some are in government jobs.

A Museum Housing Important and Rare Photos of the Andaman Tribes,Igirl,"Lowestoft, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,27-Feb-16,"The tribes of the Andamans have been the subject of much research and speculation over the years; particularly the Sentinelese who are reported to be the most isolated tribe in the world. The photos and the artefacts that were able to be obtained of some of the tribes, particularly the Sentinelese, are indeed rare. 

The museum is spread, rather thinly I think, over three floors. The impact of the displays was better received when it was housed in its former home, a small self contained unit with one caretaker. When you had finished your viewing you signed a register and left a comment. Nice and intimate I thought. Nevertheless the displays wherever, are priceless and unique and have to be preserved. 

A must visit place in my opinion to understand the various tribes in this remote part of the world.

Put those facts together, and I had a sense this place would be a disappointment. But when we found ourselves with an hour to kill on Port Blair, we thought -- why not? If you know nothing about the Andamans' native inhabitants, then you'll learn a bit about them -- tools, technologies, food, dwellings etc. But the place showcases them in a way we're told they may never have wanted to be showcased. It's a pretty conventional exhibit that doesn't tell us much about how they currently live (other than saying many keep to themselves entirely -- really? is that even possible?) or really anything very interesting (folklore? religion? belief systems? or even how tourists go see them anyway under the pretense of visiting the volcanic mud pots etc.). If you've an hour to kill, go--and since most folks don't bother thinking beyond the touristy things to do, perhaps they should. But you may be better off contemplating human existence and our ethical obligations toward tribal and other indigenous communities while watching the sun go down at Chidiya Tapu. More",Nov-15

Could have been better curated,inkybinky2013,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,11-Dec-13,"This is like reading our old history text books, with politically incorrect text like ""negros and mongoloids have XYZ racial features"" 
The dusty exhibition could have been more experiential. It's kind of sad in fact---am thinking what some (hyper)proactive places like Singapore would have done with content like this. 
This museum was like a dry bureacratic documentation with a touch of condescention. Really could have been better. But I guess at Rs 10-20 per ticket you get what you pay for. 
But do go to atleast get a sense of the native population, since they are sadly not really a part of the modern day Andamans",Dec-13

This is true to this place as it is true to many museums in the country.

Andaman and Nikobar islands are no expectation to this. When we visit these islands as a Tourist and enjoy the beauty of nature which is, still in abundance , we must not forget that we are invaders. We have encroached upon Freedom of these tribal inhabitants. This is Civilization . So, to make us understand these facts Government has set up few things together in this Museum. Various things which those tribal people were using then (and of course some of them are using today also on some remote islands) are neatly displayed in this 2 story building.Its is worth visiting.",Nov-12

Museum depicting Glimpse of Tribal life-Yesterday and Today,Satish T,"Gorakhpur, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,22-Feb-13,"I visited this museum after returning from the cellular jail. This is a centrally located place near Andman and Nicobar Tourist office. It has clean and green ambiance with aesthetically decorated frontal wall. Stepping provides it an extra grace. One should see the things in its own local context and not compare with national and international museum galleries. In that way it is a well maintained small museum. With its limited resourses it serves its purpose well. 
It provides us a glimpse of tribal life of those old days and present day living pattern and behavior of Jarwa tribal’s. There is good display of, photographs posters, models .artifacts, tools and weapons used by them. I was particularly fascinated by the replica and models of boats, canoes and huts, depicting their way of hunting, living and eating. There is small souvenir and gift shop, just before the entrance of the museum gallery. 
We enjoyed and passed about one hour in this museum and came out, thinking, their carefree way of living with minimum requirements. In contrast modern well developed civilized man with all his collections of materiel and costly gadgets seems heavily care-laden. If you come to visit this far off place and interested in knowing the life pattern of original inhabitants of these islands, it is worth visiting this museum.

"The building looks nice from out, inside nothing to hold your attention",ShareKhan4,"Sydney, Australia",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,19-Feb-13,"I've heard that the Prince of Wales museum in Mumbai has some modern styled exhibits, but having not seen it personally, i have to say that the Anthro museum falls in the category of all Indian museums - pathetic due to lack of any vision by the Anthropological Survey of India. 

The exhibits are ancient and covered with dust. There is no timeline or way of figuring out what is the current state of the various tribes mentioned. Whoever thinks this is a good museum obviously hasn't seen any normal museum in a developed country. 

There are clear signs not to touch things but you'll find some morons who insist on getting into the replica huts to get photos taken of themselves. See photo attached as evidence. 

If you have time to kill and really really want to see how some of the original inhabitants lived, then you can consider breezing through in 15 minutes. 

Its a shame that not only have we destroyed most of the tribals and their culture, but we can't even put together a decent set of exhibits to show how they lived. More",Feb-13

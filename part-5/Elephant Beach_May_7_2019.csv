beatiful sandy beach with water wondefully warm,grretabau,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,03-May-19,If you are not looking for snorkelling or diving the beach is just perfect. Mind the strong streams!,Mar-19
Lots of water sports activity !,AmitabhChakraborty,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,26-Apr-19,"Great place to visit for water sports! we could not do snorkeling, as it was closed by the authority, but we used glass boat and banana boat riding. views are just awesome.

Quirky beach,katiep319,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Apr-19,"We trekked here at about 4pm to catch the sunset. Ignore the signs that it’s shut from 3pm - the beach is still there it’s just empty! Quaint little trek past big trees and through almost marshy open spaces that look perfect for crocodiles! Everything shut when we went at 4, so can’t comment on activities there, but the deserted beach was a great find for sunset! Getting taxis away was really hard as no empty taxi or tuk tuk stops there, so book in advance!",Apr-19
Wonderful beach,thanaelakshmanaramv,"South Andaman Island, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,23-Apr-19,"The beach can be accessed by boat from jetty at Havelock or by trekking. Chose to take the boat as there was swamp at the end of trekking path before reaching the beach. There are lot of activities like jet ski, parasailing and speed boat. Unfortunately seawalking and snorkeling was stopped due to some accident when we visited the beach. The beach is scenic. Once you hire a boat three hours are givem once you reach the beach. Then you have to go back to the jetty by the same boat.",Apr-19
India .. wow .. fun place in Andaman,Kumararaj,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-Apr-19,"This is a great beach for all beach activities - Snorkelling, Ocean walk, swimming, parasailing, Water scooters, banana boat ride... 

The place is reached by a speed boat. Wear comfy shirts, T-shirt, hat, sun screen, sun glasses. Carry a pair of change clothes. The rates charged for all these activities are controlled and hence very reasonable - no bargaining. They also have snorkel kit for rent. 

Snorkelling with full mask is an event sold like crazy here. They charged us Rs.1000 for this activity - which lasted only for 5 minutes. If you have done scuba diving or snorkel elsewhere, then skip this full mask snorkelling. You will be fine with the complimentary snorkel which uses the traditional face mask and the snorkel.

Not worth visiting at the moment!,VikAndSap,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,19-Apr-19,"It is a nice beach. But, the government has banned all activities that involve getting into water. So, no scuba diving or snorkelling or even swimming in the water is allowed. You can only do para-sailing or jet-ski. These are very expensive compared to other places like Goa. I do not understand why the government should do this when people are visiting this place from so far !!! Really ruined the experience for me.",Apr-19
very good place,PriyankaArja,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Apr-19,"the beach is good. but the problem is when I visited Andaman, the beach was prohibited for scuba diving due to a person's death.",Apr-19

Decent beach,pacmybags,"London, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,17-Apr-19,There are better beaches on the island and this was my least favourite. Maybe if I had seen the elephant I would have rated it higher - otherwise it is a crowded beach. We arrived at about 8am which was the best time because by 10am it was packed with boats brining people to the beach. My advice is to go early.,Mar-19
It was too crowded,Adivik,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,13-Apr-19,Its a beautiful beach but needs to be regulated. It can end up being too crowded and you may end up waiting for long for any activity. The guides can be rude. The area behind the sports counters and eating places is really dirty.,Mar-19
Overrated!!,vinay2310,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,10-Apr-19,Beach is over rated. Very expensive to get to and recently they do not even let anyone in the water due to a recent accident. Avoid. Even the water sports out there is really expensive.,Apr-19
Beautiful small beach,KAUSHAL G,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,07-Apr-19,"Water activities are shut due to some reason, which I felt was completely illogical. Beach is scenic and small. Water is clean and best color. Good siting arrangements like tree houses. Since there was no water activity permitted it was boring to stay beyond 2 hrs",Apr-19

Best beach for water sports,Devendra G,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,29-Mar-19,"Elephant beach is the best beach for water sports in India. Trip to andaman islands is incomplete without visit to elephant beach. There are two ways to visit elephant beach. One can either visit the beach via ferry from Havelock Jetty. The ferry takes 45 mins t an hour to reach the island. One can stay in the island for three hours before returning back to Havelock Jetty. There is also an alternate route to visit the beach which is less common. One can trek from a turn near the radhanagar beach and reach the place by trekking through forest. However, it is essential to take a guide along if you are trekking, else you can be lost in the forest. Water sports are conducted in the morning as the beach shouts down by 3.00 pm in the afternoon. The activities here includes: snorkelling, sea walk, scuba diving, jet ski, banana boat ride, glass bottom boat and paragliding. When you visit via ferry, the package includes one free session of snorkelling. However, free is a misnormer. If you really want to enjoy, you will have to opt for a paid session. We did, snorkelling, sea walk, glass bottom ride and jet ski. Snorkelling and Sea walk in elephant beach is a must.

Beach for Water Sports ????,541tanmayd,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,28-Mar-19,This is a beach specifically for the water Sports.. my suggestion would be to have deep sea snorkeling instead of Scuba diving.. most of the guides are so much experienced in terms of the Sports..,Mar-19
Visit mainly for water activities..gets crowded,Varun K,"Kochi (Cochin), India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,28-Mar-19,"Elephant beach can be reached either by trekking or on a speedboat from Havelock jetty. The speedboat takes 30 mins and you should return by the same boat. You can spend about 2 hrs at the beach if you chose to go by speedboat.speedboat takes maximum 10 pax only. 

Tips 
1. Complimentary snorkelling for abt 5mins is provided for the journey by the speedboat. If you have trouble breathing through the mouth then you can rent a full mask at INR300 (as of mar 2019).With the full mask you can breathe normally.The complimentary snorkelling is very short and not much to see. You can pay INR 1000 for guided snorkelling of 10 mins including video,photos and better views of coral reefs and aquatic life. 

2. Start early as the beach gets crowded.There is a boat booking counter at Havlock ferry point 

3. Lot of water activities available at beach like para sailing, banana boat ride, scuba diving etc 

4. it has lockers, changing room, fruit/refreshments stalls More",Mar-19
matheran of andaman,praveenkumarps,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,26-Mar-19,"this is matheran equivalent of andaman. in matheran, the horse breeders control tourism. in the name of eco conservation, they do not allow motorized vehicles only to super pollute, cover the entire town by the dust that the horses raise when they forcibly take all the tourists in them. similarly, the boat owners have ganged up here and control the elephant beach tourist activities. government is blinded and does not care. a fellow tourist lost his life the day we went on 25th mar 2019, mostly due to the unhygienic, infectious gas mask provided in the sea walk. the beach is chaos, highly unsafe, unhygienic wash rooms, change rooms, etc. best avoided More",Mar-19

However, a common issue here seems to be the lack of good infrastructure - the place is just not geared to handle large crowds. If you are signing up with any of the service providers for the famed sea walk or the snorkeling excursion, be sure to either carry a android phone or a pen drive with you- if you do not have either, it costs approx Rs 700 to get your pictures loaded onto a pen drive or a CD.",Mar-19

You can do water sports activity here. Negotiate well. 

The food options are nice. 

You can go by ferry; but we took the road via jungle. Young people should be able to take the route via jungle; but avoid if you are elderly, pregnant or differently abled. At the point of entrance from main road, you can park the bike. From there it's about 2 km walk. Local people provide guider services & they talk about water upto chest level & the dense jungle. It's BS & you can go there on your own. You can simply follow someone who is going along. The jungle is dense; but not scary. You may find snake occassionaly; but snakes are shy by nature - just be cautious while walking. More",Feb-19

Well, you don't have such clear blue water in Goa, where you can see the sea bed clearly just by standing on the beach. The watersport activites are economical and is governed by the association.

"Avoid, avoid, avoid",KK06,England,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,28-Feb-19,"We’d seen the large numbers of inflatable boats leaving the Jetty packed with snorkelers and decided to go by the land route instead. They say the “jungle trek” from the road to Elephant Beach will take about 40 to 45 minutes (or even 30 minutes according to the guys by the entrance) but for us oldies it was pretty hard work - plenty of clambering over logs, very uneven ground (even when very dry), quite a lot of gradients (both up and down) and it took us more than an hour. Once we got to Elephant Beach it was like all our nightmares at once - we heard it long before we saw it. It is a melee of people, on land (taking photos of themselves and each other) and in the water where snorkelers in hi-vis life-jackets seemed to have been herded together, right next to the area where the very noisy jet-skis are zooming to and fro and lots of the small boats which brought people are lined up with mooring ropes going up across the beach. The whole place looks like an ecological disaster zone. We didn’t look to see what was on offer on land but continued eastwards towards Turtle Beach. That was much quieter and although one has to swim over a zone of dead coral there are some interesting and unusual fish for snorkelers to enjoy, as long as the tide is fairly high....

It’s a very narrow beach, no scope to enjoy a walk on the beach. Shops are very close to the shore and makes the beach rather congested. A 15min boat ride from the port, with boats offering free snockelling, not sure if it should be called that as the water area where this is done is extremely shallow ( you can walk and bend down to take a peek- don’t need a snockel)!

Very Crowded but Snorkelling good,johnandlucia,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,16-Feb-19,"You can take a boat to this beach or you can walk for about 30mins to get here from the main road (which is what we did and it is a nice walk). 

There were fifty boats anchored on the beach when we got there, so at least 500 people on the beach. So as expected very crowded, not so clean (some rubbish around) but the snorkelling (we had our own gear) was surprisingly good. If you go away from where all the boat trips take people, there were lots of fish in pretty shallow water and some coral still remained (after numerous people had stepped on it!). 

It is worth visiting but recommend to walk rather than taking a boat. If you are there late on you may even see the elephant (we saw it on the beach at 3pm).

Amazing place but too commercialized,KapoorSakshi,"Noida, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,14-Feb-19,"While booking trips you will be offered free snorkeling at this island which is fake. It is included with your boat ride actually. the free snorkeling is eye wash as they take you in muddy water and want to charge you thousand bucks if really wanna see reefs. Guides don't let you explore the reefs till where it is allowed , saying it is not allowed to go without guide and you have to pay hefty amounts to them for same, though we were carrying all the required equipment to snorkel. The place has some amazing reefs to see , so don't miss going forward. It is also scenic and has changing rooms for tourist. Every boat guide will give you 3 hours to do required activities and be back. This beach has SeaWalk to offer as well, which I didn't tried. More",Feb-19

They will design a package and ask you for your comments and the itinerary can be tweaked as per your preference/ convenience. Charges for water activities are your own, depending on what you want to go in for. They are quite flexible and considerate of your needs.

Many of the hotels offers complimentary snorkelling, which is of very short duration. Snorkelling guys can shoot photos and videos for you and will transfer all of them in your phone. 

Important Infos: 
1. Carry your phone, camera, wallet, swim suit, snorkelling gear (if you have one), towel that's it. 
2. You can rent a Locker to keep your belongings safely while you will be busy enjoying beach. 
3. If you have complimentary snorkelling, enjoy it first, return to beach and then book for extra if you wanna go for more. Do not add paid snorkelling with complimentary one in a single go. This way you can enjoy more time in water. 
4. Visit early and enjoy for more time.

"Too many tourists, go to Turtle instead",Pernilleoelgod,"Copenhagen, Denmark",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,22-Jan-19,"I was really looking forward to Elephant Beach! We’ve heard the snorkelling here sound be amazing.. The snorkelling was actually okay. But it was impossible to relax because of tourists on jetski everywhere. Going too fast on banana boats and didn’t care about the marine life. 

There is a giant boat with “sea walking” 1 meter from the end of the reef. They are driving over the reef all day long with lots of noise. You had to look up to make sure they saw you snorkelling around. 
They have tied the boat with rope around a big old coral. This made me really sad. 

The beach itself is beautiful, and if you walk past all the tourists to Turtle Beach THEN the beach is gorgeous! (But, it’s a walk away!) 

Tip: walk to Turtle Beach if you want peace and quite and “untouched” beaches. 

NB: it’s a 40 minutes hike in muddy rainforest. It’s open from 8 am to 3 pm. More",Jan-19

The beach offers a lot of water sports including sea walk, snorkeling, banana ride, glassbottom boat ride etc. We did snorkeling (what they call deep-sea snorkeling with full face mask) and all of us loved the experience. The water here is very clear and shallow and you can find shoals of small fish going around you. Its a small beach and due to lot of activities, there is a bit of crowding. But the beauty of it makes it all worth it. 

Make sure that you take the 9am (or before) boat, they only allow 3 hours on the beach and one has to return taking the same boat. Also, as the beach closes by 2:30-2:45, its better to reach early and spend full three hours.

Highly Commercialised Beach that is very dirty,ashokj338,"Pune, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,12-Jan-19,You have to either walk 3 km through the jungle to this beach or take a 20 minute boat ride to this. The boat ride experiance is completely shattering in that it is poorly managed from ticketing to the ride itself. The boats are privately run and the owners are being exploited by the governmental agencies running the show. This is a harrowing experience. The beach itself is small and every inch has some activity so hardly any place to relax on the beach or in the sea. Too many stalls on the small beach makes the whole place very dirty. The sea here is very calm and very little wave activity. Great place for snorkeling and doing some tranquil things.

They charge 950 per person for a 20 min speed boat ride to the beach. This includes a complementary snorkeling which is nothing but a joke. They take you 50m from shore and show some dead corals. For the so called better experience you need to pay 1000 per person. They take you a 100m further in to the sea and show some dead corals. Neil island provides a better option when it comes to snorkelling. Avoid water activities in elephanta beach and do them in Neil. Its a tad better there. 
Deep sea walk is decent but they charge Rs:3500 per person. Thou the boatmen say we can stay 3 hrs in the beach they try to wind up early so that they can take the next set of people. We can trek(speed beat is not the only option) to elephant beach as well. its a 45m trek. in my opinion if we have no kids its better to trek and spend half a day in the beach instead of paying the boatmen and spending less than 3 hrs there.

(3) There is no ample place to sit around and relax. The beach is extremely crowded by agencies conducting activities. To top that there are truck loads of tourists visiting this place. The moment you get onto the beach, you will meet an agency guy who will take you through complementary snorkeling ( which is super sad ). It will be good for children and very old people. They have paid snorkeling which is again useless coz they take you for like 20 feet into the sea ( really good for children and old people). Paid snorkeling comes with photographs and video ( you can feed bread to fish ). You need to have an android phone. 

(4) You can buy tickets to adventure activities either in havelock or in elephant beach. No difference. Cash only, no cards anywhere here. 

(5) Very limited options for food. Few guys selling groundnuts, bhel puri etc. One stall sells fruits. Carry food from havelock. 

(6) You cannot swim around in the waters. Only kids were allowed to play in the shallows. One part of the beach has a lot of speed boat rides , banana rides, jet ski etc.. The other part has all these agencies conducting snorkeling. Remaining parts of the beach are restricted. So basically you need to sit on the beach somewhere and while away time. 3 hours on this beach is a complete waste of time. 

Suggest you to book one of those resorts which has a beach as a part of the resort ( many resorts have this option), and spend few hours in the morning there. More",Nov-18

It is easily accessible from the jetty - a boat takes you there, waits for you for three hours and takes you back. We have been told that trekking path to the beach gets muddy and dangerous after the rain (which is not rare). Unfortunately, the beach is quite crowded, though for some reason tourists tend to stay close to the shore, so you just pass them by and then hang in the water watching the marine life:) I have seen snorkelling instructors providing help to those who can’t swim.

We decided to reach elephant beach by trek. The trek trail due to heavy rains was all wet, muddy and slippery. What a journey it was. One thing let me tell you- anyone can trek when the land beneath your foot is rock solid, but when the same is just slipping away? God I will never forget this journey. The slippery trek. We almost took 2 hrs to cover just 1.8 Kms. Barefoot, slipping here and there, feet covered in mud,taking one step at a time, not bothered about the distance left. We somehow managed to reach the end. As we walked through the last canopy of trees.. the trek ended on a mesmerising mangrove beach. The light at the end of that slipperry tunnel was in deed worth it. Rid of all the anguish, the pain, the sweat it was only for this gain. Mangrove trees, thousands on small crabs, as we ventured ahead, the majestic elephant beach did welcome us with open arms. 
We did snorkeling there and it was out of the world experience. 
As they say- No pain No gain. More",Dec-18

Also the best part in havelock and neil island you get bikes for hire and you can keep it any where in the tourist sopts as there is no problem with thief's in the entire islands.

Most popular beach for watersports in Andamans,rash317,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,05-Nov-18,"Elephant Beach is beautiful and is the most popular place in the Andamans for water sports like snorkeling, coral watching, under sea walking, jet skiing and other water fun rides. This beach is 15 min speedboat ride away from Havelock and is part of the itineraries of all organizers. Activities are conducted between 9 am to 3 pm. Visitors are allocated a speed boat for a duration of about 3 hours for transfer to and from the beach in which to finish the fun activities. All the activities seem to be conducted by a single operator so its important to plan the sequence well in order not to waste time in queues but enjoy yourself. 
This is the best place for coral watching in the Andamans since the corals here are the most colourful. Being in shallow waters here corals can be seen by snorkeling. One does not need any special clothing or swimming experience to enjoy the beautiful corals. Operators like Makemytrip, Thomas Cook, etc. offer free snorkeling sessions which are a disappointment since the sessions are not monitored by the Operators and the local snorkeling guides make a hash of them to make a quick buck by offering better snorkel and longer snorkeling experience on cash payment.

Complete the sea walk first and ask the boat guy to take you to the sea walk place first. come back and plan the snorkelling. The snorkelling included in most packages is useless, they take you a few meters..its more like an advert. Plan to take the paid snorkelling (INR 800/ person)...it is worth the money

It is a small beach as I could see it; but has easy viewing of corals and underwater fish of various colourful varieties. 

Initially, I wondered why the funny name when there could not have been existence of elephants on such s a small island. This doubt was cleared as a baby elephant appeared on the beach from almost nowhere and gave a fright to the beach tourists. Luckily, it was shooed away by locals.

We are beach lovers and have visited many beach destinations in India and abroad like Goa, Kerala, Phuket, Krabi..but honestly the kind of raw sublime beauty that we came across at the beaches in Andamans is surreal. 
Elephant beach is a 10 mins speed boat ride from Havelock. The local govt has provided for a number of adventure sports like jet ski, banana boat ride, sea walk, scuba, and snorkelling experience for the tourists. One thing which we liked about Andamans is that locals are largely very honest, helpful and friendly. So much lesser chances of being cheated in terms of boat fares, pricing for the sea activities, commutes etc. This beach is an excellent place to experience snorkelling as their are trained divers who guide you through the process. They hold you by your hand and make non swimmers totally comfortable during snorkelling. Beautiful, unique under water sights with innumerable fishes and corals can be viewed. Tourists are allowed to stay at this beach max till about 1 oclock. Light snacks, fresh fruit chat and coconut water is available at the beach. More",Nov-17

We had a great time with our family in the amazing archipelago of islands. The one that I particularly remember is the trip to Elephant Beaches which was so much fun. The staff was very supportive and catered to all our needs during our travel. They ensured a smooth travel and took us to the mesmerizing Elephant beach, situated in Havelock Islands. The crystal clear water and the gleaming silver beaches are wonderful sights and you can keep gazing at them for hours. The beach has a lot of activities for the adventure lovers like sea walking, snorkelling, kayaking etc. A lifeguard had also been hired for the safety of the visitors. We went snorkelling and were amused by the marine life dwelling in the sea. After a while, we went on a ride in the speedboat available and later rested in the shade of the trees waiting to witness the beautiful sunset.

Snorkeling with full mask and sea walk is must at elephant beach... 

No need to pre boom any water sport activity. You can buy on the spot any Activity you need.

The trek is through forest, so we had glimpse of unique flora of Andamans and the typical Andaman forest. 

The trek difficulty is mild and even senior citizens could complete the trek without any difficulty. 

The trek ends exactly on elephant beach, which has its unique topography. If one is not interested in sea activities, there is nothing to do here. There is no road connection to the beach and there are no other facilities here.

Best Family time in Havelock,SatyenS21,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Apr-18,"We were pleasantly surprised with our 3 hour experience at this beach. Lovey corals within a short distance and without much depth.Also calmer waters which can be enjoyed for a longer time. Specially recommend to those who can not do scuba for any reason. For an extra charge of 800, (you mandatorily pay 950 for the ferry and basic snorkeling), one can explore the entire area and experience the life under-water. 
The guides who will take you through the sea-walk, though, are non-professionals and appear rustic..take care while picking one!!!",Apr-18

This beach is famous for Snorkeling as corals start at a depth of 1 meter. Boat owner would ask you for other water activities but I would recommend to finish the complimentary snorkeling provided with the ticket first and then go for Deep sea snorkeling. A must do activity (deep sea snorkeling) where you would be taken to deep sea and your dream to watch live corals would come alive. Even if you have done scuba diving, I would recommend to take this activity and experience once in lifetime. You would be allowed to feed colorful fishes. The moment you start feeding, you would be surrounded by fishes. Don't try to catch them as you would not be able to :D Post the activities you can simply relax on the beach water. NO waves here. Also use free changing rooms instead of paid service as paid one is very small and crowdy. Do not waste your time in paid changing rooms as you have only 3 hour for elephant beach ride More",Mar-18

We had 2 kids (11 and 7) and not for once did they complain about the path. Its a pretty simple walk (luckily this was dry season) and it culminates in absolute beauty where the forest enters the mangroves that in turn enters the sea! We swam and snorkeled by ourselves and trekked back (saw 2 snakes while coming back). However, would recommend taking a guide for the trek.

Though it is published that a complimentary snorkeling trip is on offer with the 900 Rs boat ticket but that is hardly a 4-5 minute tour in to the water. The whole purpose of it is to sell you another tour of 20 mins of 800 bucks! You can trek to this beach for 2 km on the way to Radhanagar beach! Hardly 5-6 shops selling overpriced snacks.

Snorkeling and glass-bottomed boat,SmithaSrikanth,"Chennai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,06-Mar-18,"Packages (around 800rs) on offer for guided snorkelling are available and are worth it...with pics and video too (ask them to take more footage of the marine life as your face isn't visible beneath the mask.) My 70 year old Mother-in-law did this as well as a 59 year old and 47 year old in our group...so age is no limit for adventurous spirits. They put a full face snorkel mask which allows you to breathe normally and you just have to float on the ocean's surface. Very strong young guides will hold your hand and take you over the reef...incredible experience for a group of first-timers. A wonderful look at the ocean life as well - a view of diverse marine life. The glass-bottomed boat provides a clear view of the life in the reefs below and is worth the expense (400rs per person). Plus the unforgettable wind in face experience of being in a boat. 
Lovely place for swimming and relaxing. You can access this beach from either Radhanagar beach or speedboat operators from the Havelock Jetty.

I will not advise this trekking for senior citizens(depends on their physical health also) as at some places it will become a bit tiring(It also depends on the path we take). Also,the paths can become slippery after rains so better avoid trekking if it has rained in previous day. Only a few tourists opt for trekking to Elephant beach . 

The water on this beach is crystal clear but the beach is crowded. We did snorkeling here which costed us Rs 800 per person .They give us pictures and a video(Which is included in 800 Rs) on Andriod phone.Please ensure shareit is there on the phone. For people who do not have andriod phone they will give Picture & video in a CD for a charge( I think its Rs 100). The locker charges are Rs 50.00 per locker. Changing rooms are there and it is free. 

We had coconut water on the which costed us Rs 40.00 it was very refreshing. We started our walk back at about 12:45 Pm. When we start trekking just as we leave Elephant beach we can see water( which we did not see while coming),later on inquiry people there said it was because of high tide starting. Many boards on Elephant beach and at the point where trekking starts says Elephant beach closes at 2:00 pm,so plan accordingly. 

I will recommended to reach this beach say by 9:00 Am so that you can reach back to your hotel by noon and take rest or if you want to go to radhanagar beach from Elephant beach that is also possible as you can get buses from the point where trek starts to Radhanagar beach. Autos may be a bit difficult to get from the place where trekking starts.

"Beautiful beach, getting ruined by tour companies and uneducated tourists",anza22,"Seattle, Washington",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,22-Feb-18,"I could not believe what I witnessed at this beach. We had (unfortunately) booked a tour with an Indian tour company and were taken to Elephant Beach. It was a horrible experience and I would not recommend it. First off, you wait for hours at the jetty without guidance. Then you take a boat ride to the beach. It is so crowded with tourists. You receive sub par snorkeling equipment. Guides there take tourists (mostly Indian, domestic) into a small area of coral and presumably because most of the tourists cannot swim and because the water is so shallow, the guides WALK on the reef to guide the tourists. I am not sure if they understand that coral is alive and that they are doing such a disservice to the marine life or if they are just trying to make money at any cost. Since we are capable swimmers, we snorkeled a bit further out and witnessed some of the most beautiful coral we have seen on our world travels. It was jellyfish season so that was a bit of a tough aftermath but the marine life was absolutely spectacular. I hope the government gets involved to save this beach and its coral before it is too late. More",Jan-18

Active beach,Manohar B,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,05-Feb-18,"As everybody has mentioned, this is the beach for various water activities. 
That apart, the waters here offer the most amazing colors of blue and green shades 
There are 2 ways to reach this beach: 
1. Take a boat ride from Jetty (40 mins) [Rs.950 per head] 
2. Trek for 2 Kms through mangrove forest (45 mins to 1 hr) [Rs.500 for guide] 

I highly recommend the trek option due to following reasons: 
1. For a group of people it is more cost effective 
2. The natural forest in the path is so adventurous. We spotted a snake, a gheko, a chamelon and loads of shell fish, hermit frogs etc. 
3. It is not all that difficult as some of the people may have you believe. My father who is 61 years old was able to the trek both ways without any issues. 
4. You don't have time limit of 2.5 hours for the return boat. 

There is a 200 meter stretch where you would have to wade through ankle/knee level water, but it is not as bad because the surface is soft and the water is clean. 
I have posted some pics of the trek. 
Although, it is best to avoid if it had rained continuously 1 or 2 days before your visit. More",Feb-18

There are guides who can walk you up and down the path - which is not necessary but a nice to have. The actual beach is quite manic -overrun with Jet skis and people hopping on a boat to tube. You can find a secluded spot if you walk a bit further on. Snorkelling was nice off the beach- but too close to commotion. Tide was high, otherwise apparently walking to Turtle beach from Elephant beach is best for snorkelling. Overall lots of commotion.

In banana ride, one rides on a banana type boat being pulled by another speed boat and in the middle of the beach waters, the banana boat is capsized and all the occupants fell in the water, their life jackets save them from going into the water. After a little while, the occupants are again pulled on the banana boat and return to the beach. More",Oct-17
Wow,MorneKo,"Stellenbosch, South Africa",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,01-Nov-17,"I hiked the 1.8km from the Mainroad through a beautiful dense forest on a very muddy and uneven trail, not something I will recommend with kids or without proper gear but it was very satisfying. I did it early morning and reached the beach before 8 when a lot of boats arrive with tourist wanting to do water sports... A boat ride from the jetty to Elephant Beach cost around Rs900/-. Underwater walking cost Rs3500/- including the boat cost. 
There are food stalls and life guards and toilets though no roads.",Nov-17

Must get away from the crowds,Jim B,Hove,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,28-Oct-17,This is a short motor boat ride from the ferry port. When you get there you will end up on a very crowded bit of beach with lots of water sports. Another example of poor tourist development that will destroy the attraction.

You can charter boats or go along with others in boats with a capacity of about 10. Snorkelling is complimentary with the boat ride. A forty five minute boat ride and you reach elephanta beach. As this is a forest beach, shops are limited and you are advised to carry drinking water and snacks. The activities last for about three hours. The complimentary snorkelling is very superficial. You have to make extra payment for the deep sea snorkelling with photography. But, I assure you that it is worth it. Otherwise the glass bottom boat ride would be an ideal option. The seabed with it wide range of corals and fish is an enthralling sight. Few water sports activities are also done here (banana ride, jet ski, double boat). 
The beach is kept clean and you are advised to not litter. A walk along the shore will give you a lot of beautiful photographs. Trekking options are also available with forest officials guiding you.

But it was all worth it. I'd rate Elephant beach right next to Radhanagar beach. But they are kind of opposite too. You can spend more time in the beach in Radhanagar, but in Elephant beach all the fun is in the water. It's just fantastic for Snorkeling.

Great Snorkeling Experience!,Greenismycolor,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,09-Aug-17,"Visited in Dec 2016 

Good Place to Snorkel, not as beautiful as Jolly Buoy though… 

Reach Havelock beach early to get an early ride on the Jetty to Elephant Beach…We had to wait good 2 hours… 

Swimming in the Beach (shallow) is good, but you have to opt to snorkel as there is nothing much to do… 

Bathroom/Changing rooms (or see thru huts) need to be renovated/updated with decent rooms as this place gets crowded. There is no door as such so anyone can walk in on you…Some cubicles were soo dirty and few despicable women had thrown stuff which no one should see… 

Locker Facility is good though. 

Best Part of the trip was snorkeling….snorkeled beyond the max point and it was gorgeous.. It was safe as the guide doesn’t let go off your hand and you have a lifebuoy around you. Abundant Corals and Sea Creatures… & you can spot some large colorful fishes too.

We trekked across the mountains (45 mins. Not too steep but can get slippery if it rains) and got there by 8 am to get in some snorkeling time before the crowds came in. 

Word of advice - if you are hiring divers to take you out for guided snorkeling then push them to take you the moment you reach. Else they make excuses about divers not being there and delay so that more people can come in and they can club groups. I figured out what they were up to because I speak Bengali and could hear them chatting. Had to throw a massive tantrum after they made us wait 20 mins and then miraculously a 'diver' appeared from the group that had been sitting and chilling there all along.

Waste of time - Never visit Elephant Beach !,Yogesh B,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,17-May-17,"Waste of half day if you visit Elephant beach. It is like a 'Pond'. Beach is not good for swimming / going into sea. Snorkling is done in very shallow water and it is too crowded. There are other beaches where better snorkling is provided. At bharatpur beach, the glass bottom boat ride provides snorkling and it is done in deep sea. One has to go to Elephanta beach in a boat from Havellock Jetty and return in the same boat. There is no option to return early on your own. At havelock, if you need to enjoy beach, go only to Radhanagar beach and do not waste time in seeing Elephanta and Kala Paththar beaches. More",May-17
Lot of water activity options,ABHISHEK B,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,16-May-17,"There are two ways in which this beach can be accessed. Either you trek through the jungle in a well marked route and reach here, or take a ferry from the Havelock Harbour (Rs. 750/- each). We took the second option, so I won't be commenting on the trek part. But, I guess the trek will be exciting. If you go Andaman via some tour operator, then your life is easy. They will take care of your reservations and will plan the trip. Trust me, getting tickets and permits on your own is very hectic (though not impossible). Nevertheless, maximum of 8 people (+ 2 operators) are loaded on the ferries. it can be 6+2 as well depending upon the boat capacity. The ferries looked to be in good condition and were safe. The operators will request you to put on life jackets. It's better to put them in as you will be traveling through ocean water with 100-120 meters depth. The trip duration is roughly 30 minutes one way. This trip is really exciting as you can see the mangrove jungles on the way and can witness the flying fishes if you are in luck. Sailing across the deep ocean on a ferry is really exciting and it's a very unique experience. Talking about the beach, the water is very clean.

Talking about the beach, the water is very clean. By afternoon when the low tide starts, the ocean will go back significantly. There are lot of water activity options available like snorkeling, speed boat etc. But, I felt things are very commercialized and expensive here. You can rent lockers here. I think even for using washrooms you have to pay. If you are visiting Jolly Buoy/Red Skin island, then you can skip the Snorkeling here. The under water life in those islands are unbelievable compared to Elephant Island. In case if you are not interested in any water activity, or rather don't want to get in the water, then you can walk around the beach. There will be hardly in any crowd if you move either ways on the beach. And trust me, you should definitely move away from the main tourist center of the beach and explore the other parts. It's very beautiful and you can spend some time in solitaire. The dead tree logs, mangrove trees etc. makes these lesser crowded places of the beach extremely beautiful. You will surely get lot of good photo opportunities on these places. We spent all our time exploring these areas and it was so peaceful and enjoyed every bit of our time. You can see so many varieties of snails if you move out from the main tourist place. but remember it's illegal to carry any snails wit you from there. 

You get some food items there, like fruit salad, fruit chaat, peanuts, chips and other similar snacks. It's very sad to see tourist littering on this beautiful beach. PLEASE DON'T LITTER AROUND AND CONSERVE THE BEAUTY OF NATURE. PLEASE. 

You will get around 3hours in Elephant beach, then you will be traveling back to Havelock Harbour area in the same ferry on which you traveled. 

Some tips: 
- Make sure you move out from the main center and explore either side of the beach 
- Its better to carry your own snorkeling kit. the ones you get here aren't great 
- you get BSNL, Airtel network here 
- If you are visiting Jolly Buoy/Red Skin islands, then save the snorkeling session for those islands, It will be expensive there but the marine life that you see in these islands are just unbelievable. 
- Stuffs are quite expensive here, so if you are planning to buy anything, be prepared to shell out more 
- Make sure you wear the life jacket while traveling to the beach on ferry 
- Please do not litter around. use the waste bins. More",Apr-17

Beautiful beach ruined by greed,Danni W,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,15-May-17,"Elephant beach is accessed by boat (750rp) or by walking through the jungle on the well marked path. At the end of the path is the mangroves, it can be a little scary when you walk through shin deep water but many walk this path each day. Just keep a look out for signs and or warnings from locals about crocodiles. We arrived at elephant beach at 7:30 am and we were the first ones there, the crystal clear waters are a welcome sight and the popular snorkelling point can be seen easily as it's marked with a net barrier. An Indian tourist had told us the day before that you can rent snorkelling gear for (250rp), when we asked to hire gear they asked for (1,000.00rp) we tried to explain that we knew the cost was 250. After some time we gave up as we refused to pay (800.00rp each)! We left the beach without snorkelling, feeling cheated that we missed out on a wonderful underwater opportunity.

Good clean beach. White powder like sand and clean water. The facilities are very good also. There are toilet, shower and locker facility. But it is paid.

Carry your own water bottles and bring them back. 
Scuba diving was not available here when we went. There were snorkelling, sea floor walking, banana boat ride, jet boat ride available. The free snorkelling included in the Rs 750 ticket is not worth as the guide only takes us a very short distance were there is not much to see.

Amazing snorkeling experience at a decent rate,SanthoshRajan,"Chennai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,07-May-17,"Elephant beach is a 20 min boat ride away from the Havelock jetty. As a complimentary, the boat operators provide free snorkelling. But they would insist you to take a 500 per head, a much longer snorkelling experience. If you are a person who normally says no to these kinds of proposals, please don't this time. This is the best rate you could find anywhere. A good snorkelling experience is guaranteed. You don't need to know swimming. All the corals and different species of marine lives awestruck me. They provided many photos and a 4 min long video. Instead of spending a huge amount on Seawalking, you could enjoy for a longer time and without much difficulties, at this beach. The beach also has some other watersports.

The path is wide and not easy to miss. Some tiny lizards, butterflies, kittens(!) but nothing more dangerous. On rainy days it said its possible to attract leach but this day was obviously to dry for them. The path is sometimes a bit steep which might make you slip in the mud that covers the path. So I wore sneakers with a good grip so was no problems. Most walk in slippers and they where doing fine this day. 

When close to the beach you need to pass a little swamp with a sandmud pretty solid ground. This day it was almost dry so didnt even get wet. 

The beach is nice and if you arrive early like 6-7 AM you practicly have the beach for your self. The crowds came at 8 this day.

Crowded beachTrekking to Beach was amazing,Abhijith A,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,23-Mar-17,"You can go to this beach by trekking or by Boat. 
We walked around 2 km through dense forest and that was amazing. There will be guides offering help at the entry. But we did not accept their help. 
You will find a split after 100m from starting point, just take the middle road and you will reach a wooden bridge after 200-400m. After that you can take any route, because all those routes will merge at some point. Once you reach beach, you need to take a left turn. You will find a lot of people and boats in the beach.",Mar-17
Nice Beach for water sports,SKonambi,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,23-Mar-17,"There are 2 ways to get in to Elephant Beach 
1. Trekking via jungle & mangroves, the starting point can be found approximately 8 KM from Havelock Jetty on the way to Radhanagar Beach, 
2. 10 Mins Boat Ride (Fast Boat) from Havelock Jetty 

We took the fast boat ride, and you will be taken back by the same boat after 3 hours. Lots of options for water activities, like scuba, sea walking, jet ski and other rides, unfortunately snorkeling was closed when we visited. 

Local vendors will be selling coconut waters and fruits. Lockers and Changing rooms are available.

Too crowded,parijat_2000,"Noida, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,23-Mar-17,"Wow!!! What a place... So, let's go and ruin that place completely. We humans are best in this only and since 2016 it's happening. Most noisy and crowded place among Havelock beaches. 

Visited here TWICE 2015 and 2017. 

Not sure what is the idea behind starting water sports activities, as main Andaman island and Havelock island is famous n best for under water activities, not for cruising over the water. 

Its was a great disappointment for me in 2017. 

Yes, when I was there IN 2015 it was a great great place. This time i felt that I am in between of a mela or a fish market. It took me good 20 mins to wipe out 2015 elephant beach memories for next 2 hours as I was going to stay there for next 2 hours. 
Again I will say better invest your time and energy at radha nagar rather than elephant beach. 
Very very noisy and crowded. Ufff. 

I wish administration should consider to declare 2 days completely off for the beach or at-least shutdown water activities for 2 days. Better to give some time to nature to recover it self from the commercialisation that we humans did. 
What I felt was that Havelock is turning into more of commercial place than a peaceful place. 
Still after reconsidering my review I'll give 1 star (max 2 star) to elephant beach. More",Feb-17

The Sea Walking was great and that wraps it up. 
Other water activities are also available like rides and stuff but it is over-priced as hell, So is sea walking tough. 
Go for Scuba Instead or snorkelling (Sea walking costed 3000 Rs. per head with 750 Rs fee to reach the Elephant beach, In our case Rs.3000 as we had to hire the whole boat for we were running late).

The Adventure Beach of Havelock,892aliyad,"Pune, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,10-Mar-17,"Well naming this as an adventure beach because reaching the beach itself is an adventure. You can reach the beach by two ways: 
1. Speed Boat Ride 
2. A 1.8km jungle trek 

For speed boat ride you need to reach the jetty at the earliest, you can take a private speed boat or opt for a shared ride. You can stay on the beach for 3hrs. They offer a complementary snorkelling with the tickets to the beach. But note that snorkelling is very basic and of 15mins hardly. So better opt for a longer snorkelling for which you can pay a bit extra like we did. 

For the jungle trek, you will be dropped by you cabbie to a point from where the trek starts, then make you bookings and reach the beach. 
You may get glimpses of elephants present in that jungle while doing this trek.

Lately Snorkeling is banned for non-certified swimmers. Hence, most people were opting to ""sea-walk"" which costs Rs.3,200 per person. It's waste of money and time! Rather, one can do Snorkeling/ Scuba with professionals like ""ScubaLov"", which offers better experience and safety (one-on-one trainer)!

(Rs. 3200/- per person with complementary under water pictures; for video they will charge extra - We paid Rs. 700/- for a couple for a video of 3.5 min duration; but is worth having. They will give you a CD or soft copy in your mobile. make sure to have the back up in pen drive or other mobile immediately, so that you do not loose the pics/vids in case of mobile/SD card malfunction) 

Now some information: 

It takes around 20 min on speed boat to travel from Havelock to this island 
Once there you can do whatever you want. Generally the speed boat person will tell you to return in 3 hours time, which I guess is good enough time to spend on the beach including snorkeling and sea walk. 

The beach closes by 3:30 PM. You need to start your return boat to Havelock before that. 

Tit bits for eating is available. Changing room and wash rooms are available here. 
Absolutely clean and beautiful place. 

For Sea walk, tickets available here (Sea Link adventures). You need to reach out to a ship (sort of) from the elephant beach on speed boat for seal walk, where they have made arrangements for the activity. After sea walk, you may return to the beach or head back to Havelock on speed boat. 

Sea walk is worth doing.Rs. 3200/- per person. More",Feb-17
Good snorkelling if you get away from the crowds,Marylin D,"Leamington Spa, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,12-Feb-17,"The journey from the Havelock beach is by speed boat – and is quite bumpy – so be aware if you are easily sea-sick. You are restricted on the time you can spend here – a little under 3 hours, but you don't need a guide to go snorkelling. The main snorkelling area is very overcrowded resulting in increased pollution and reduced visibility, however if you swim out far enough then it's pretty good. There is also the opportunity here to do a Marine Walk, where you walk on the sea bed wearing a kind of diver's helmet with an airline. However you need to have bought your ticket in advance on Havelock. You need to take water with you as you can't buy any at Elephant Bay. More",Feb-17

My advice is don't go for complementary session but instead take paid session(500 rupees per person).

"Crowded, very less time for snorkelling",Adwait3785,"Pune, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,25-Nov-16,"Usually the elephant beach ride is accompanied with a complimentary snorkeling activity - just 10 mins dip per person. 
The coordinators on the beach, ask you to extend it to 20 mins taking a bit deep inside in Rs.300/- extra. If you decline that offer the complimentary one is conducted as a mere obligation and the coordinating group starts acting bit rudely. Out of the 5 people group only 3 were planning to do the snorkeling, so we asked for extra 2 turns to be done by any of the other 3, but were declined. 
The glasses offered for the snorkeling are just 1 size for all, you use as it is or you say no. Later on we discovered there were glasses and safety tubes on rental basis and those were much better than the ones used in the complimentary. 

One good thing to mention was even during that 10 min activity we saw lot many and variety of fishes. The species were different than what we saw in scuba dive, but certainly very beautiful, that's the reason 10 mins activity is not sufficient. Since it is very crowded, you are forced to keep moving irrespective of a good fish you happen to find and want to spend some time. 
Best thing would be to rent out glasses and safety float and try it yourselves.

Great Day Out,margaritta3,Lincs,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,17-Sep-16,"We spent the best part of a day here and it was lovely. There are some watersports to try or you can just enjoy the swimming. 
You can either arrive by boat from the jetty r you can walk from the road - well treck! It takes about 25 mins to walk and you need good shoes as the ground is uneven. We saw two elephants when we walked, so would recommend this. 

*Warning* Check the tides as you can only walk when the tide is out. We made the mistake of trecking and arriving when the tide was in. It is a mangrove and you have to wade through the water which was almost waist high (I am 5ft 3inches) and you cannot see what is in the water. There are salt water crocodiles in the area so please be careful and avoid the tide More",Nov-15

While in a ship with water depth of around 10 to 15 meter I can still see the sea bed and fishes from the deck. 

To reach here we need to take a boat from havelock jetty. The speed boat ride is a fun in itself. The sea around a island is much different from the sea besides land. 
This beach provides many water activities like snorkelling which is one of the best things I have done till now. The sea bed is so full of flora and fauna that snorkelling beats my scuba experience in havelock. 
Sea walk is also available. It's good to do and most easy under water activity. 

There are other activities like banana boat, etc bug since I had done all those previously so didn't did anything. 

Recommend to carry your own food and water as there is nothing much available. Try to cash for water activities. But the staff their is very nice so they will let you do the activities and collect the cash from hotel also. 

It's a reserved forest territory so only pal lowed to stay there for 2 1/2 hours. It's a great step I think to preserve the forests and the water bodies. More",Mar-16

After a good 45 min stint we reached a Mangrove that seemed like a videogame, the guide asked us to walk and baby crabs paved a path for us and after that an island like none seen before. Calm, branches of designer trees lay on the beach and no or more than 10 people. 

We went snorkelling in the rain, it was an experience to last a lifetime. On the way back to take a fisherman's boat, although we were not allowed to and considering the ferries were not there due to rain. 

This was another experience, on the way we watched the fisherman catch their dinner. More",May-16

A must do for the trek through the jungle and the mangroves in the last stretch. The water is the most still that we saw amongst all the other beaches at Havelock. The snorkeling guides were average and out to get the maximum amount of money for the least amount of service. The marine life at least at the free site is moderate but its amazing that marine life exists there inspite of the tons of people who visit this place not necessarily careful about touching the corals or fish. We even had a huge starfish lying close to the area we were swimming at the beach. So looks like the marine life at this spot is used to having prying human eyes at close quarters. More,May-16

Must Visit on Havelock Trip,Baiju_Eyes,"Noida, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,09-Apr-16,"This is a beach accessible only by either a 45 min trek or by boat (20 mins Rs 750/-). Boats go from the main jetty and preferably take a small speed boat for best fun. The beach has all water sports activities like snorkeling (free 10 mins), sea walk, water scooter etc. Also good for swimming and family fun. Amenities though paid are poorly run and kept.

There are no elephants and water sports here are rubbish,Ayam14,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,07-Apr-16,"We took the walking path after arriving by motorbike on the main road although you can take a boat which I think would be better. We were taken by a local guide through the forest it took 30 minutes but it was very tiring and the path was never level so this is not an easy route at all, one woman fell very badly. (please note you have to pay 10 INR for the guide they dont tell you this in the beginning). Eventually we reached the beach after waling through a salt marsh. My first impression was that it wasnt worth the effort getting there and that radhanagar is better. Anyway we colled off in the beach and did some snorkling. Another important point is that all over the andaman where there are tours, you will not be able to snorkle far without paying for a guide. Personally I think its just another way for them to get money from you. Anyway we bought our own snorkle gear and swam around. The coral is mostly dead all over the andamans but here we did see some fish. The only water sports was jet skiing and banana boat. We tried the jet ski and I was shocked that they dont allow you to drive it you basically sit on the jet ski while the guide takes you around. Water sports are really poor in the andamans so dont come here... We took the walking path after arriving by motorbike on the main road although you can take a boat which I think would be better.

Must visit this place in havelock,manumittal2k,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,06-Apr-16,"We went to this beach on the second day by ferry ride and thoroughly enjoyed clear waters. 
Jetski ride, water snorkeling, and sea walk are the things which you don't want to miss here. 

But there is more to it. 

We went here on third day by road. 
There is a road that goes from jungle (one way to radhanagar beach) to elephant beach. 

Only adventurous people should opt for this road as it has a good 40-50 minute walk that goes from swamp full of crabs, insects, many more ugly things. 
We thoroughly enjoyed the walk, better than the ferry ride. 
It's free, it's fun and it's adventurous.

Primarily the place for water sports!,ShRmT,"Begaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,05-Apr-16,"This is very nice beach. You need to either take a 15 min speed boat ride or 45 min trek to get there. They typically give you a boat which takes you to Elephant beach and gets you back after allowing you 2-3 hours there. Their way of assigning boats is very chaotic. If you miss the boats in first batch then you are likely to wait for a couple of hours before the boats return and it's your turn. This is a big improvement factor for them. They have to streamline this part and save people's time. 
Beautiful views with clear waters and amazing colors. There are quite a few water sports activities here, including sea walk. Sea walk was an amazing experience. 
Snorkeling, which is typically included with your price for the trip, is nice and you get to see the corals and fish up close. Glass bottom boat is also available which is good for senior citizens who can't go for sea walk or snorkeling. I only wished that the glass bottom was little bit bigger than it is. Got to see nice, colorful corals and fish.

The walk thus features, swampy land, crabs, shells, and frog fish, making it a unique experience. The beach itself is good for relaxing and snorkeling, although it was surprisingly noisy - the boats that ferry passengers also offer water sports, so you have people using jet skis and banana boats all the time. The water at this beach has a lot of jellyfish, but the small, non-poisonous variety. Overall, a visit is recommended. The beach shuts by around 3 PM, so go here in the morning More",Mar-16

However, mind you that you could be unlucky not to get to get there, as the approach to this beach from havelock jetty is through motor boats and the approacj is quite rocky. So even if the weather is slightly rough or the wind speed is slightly more than normal, the port authorities / coast guard don't allow the motorboats to operate and then they instead take you to one smaller beach called 'lighthouse beach'.

Need to be lucky to visit Elephanta - worth the effort,Dhiman_HD,"Hong Kong, China",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,25-Jan-16,"Quick Tips: 
1. Visit Jetty at 7:45 AM to get the first boat to Elephanta beach @ 700 per person. If you get late - singular boats are super expensive (3k+) 
2. You will find a wooden counter to get tickets (a form needs to be filled here) 
3. By around the ticket issuing authority gets a call regarding weather being good or not to travel from Havelock Jetty to Elephanta. If not the trip gets cancelled and is diverted to lighthouse beach mid-way to Elephanta 
4. Another way to reach Elephanta is on foot via jungle - preferred only by very enthusiastic adventurers.

Not much to eat here but you can buy the fruit chat plate which is refreshing with a lot of varieties of fruits that we don't otherwise eat ;) If you have been to Jolly Buoy before this then you will not like it so much here because underwater life is best at Jolly Buoy and this is nowhere close!

Beware of the waters. Rite till the end of the beach there are thousands of dead corals that are damn sharp and dangerous. Its so hard to even stand in the water and if by mistake you step on one of the dead coral like my friend did ur leg will be badly hurt. 
But if you go a little deep inside you will see plenty of live corals and fishes also. 
Snorkel on rent is available for unlimited time for 100 bucks . 
Unlike other people who take the early morning ferry we decided to take a hike through the jungle . 
We rode our bike and parked it at the main road where everyone does who walked through the jungle to the beach which took abt 45 mins. Carry water if ur doing this and beware of snakes and other insects. Not everybody can enjoy this. 
A little away from the main beach area on both sides there are fallen trees frm the Tsunami that make up for insane Picture don’t miss this there.

Best place for water rides. Have fun!!!,Kannan R,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,09-Jan-16,"All that pain staking wait from 7 Am to 9 for the boat to arrive had gone once we got into the speed boat assigned to us. 

The ride to elephanta beach from the Havelock jetty is through a speed boat and ride was so much fun and adventurous!!! 
We went with our 2 year old son and we're a bit nervous since the ride was quite bumpy in a few places where the sea was a bit rough. 

But my son thorough enjoyed his ride and had a great time. Once you reached the beach, you will have only few hours to enjoy as the beach closes early by 2.30pm or 3 pm. 
So don't waste your time and enjoy the swimming snorkeling, water scooter rides, banana board rides and many other fun rides. 

It was worth waiting in the morning as we had a FUNTASTIC day!!!! More",Dec-15

Top pick for water sports,npathrella,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,16-Dec-15,"If you are interested in 'touristy' water sports activities then this is your kind of place. A few minutes boat ride away from the main Havelock island, Elephanta offers many water sports options for people across all age groups - swimmers and non swimmers - initiated and non-initiated. Key points from my visit: 1. Its crystal clear waters invite you to jump in and enjoy the beach area - you will have no complaints from the beach 2. Its going to be slightly crowded - after all its the main attraction for water sports in Havelock. there are 2 time slots to visit the beach - one in morning (9:00am) and one in the afternoon (around 12:00 noon). I suggest you pick the first option as the water is calmer (works for snorkeling and glass boat ride) and its not too hot at this time 3. Some activities are overpriced - such as jet-ski, banana boat....we felt its not worth the time. However, snorkeling is so damn awesome! Take the full package (INR 300/-) and go see the beautiful sea life in the deep end of the beach. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT! It was my first time and i was more than ecstatic.

4. Since there are too many things happening on the beach at the same time it gets little annoying to hear speed boat engines roar continuously (even when you are submerged in water for snorkeling). Noisy but those who do not mind company/crowd should have a nice time 
5. Children, ladies, people of all age groups have something or the other to enjoy on this beach 
6. Change rooms and toilets are easily accessible 
7. Light snacks and water/soft drinks also easily available 

Those who want a richer snorkeling time (better sea-life), check with your hotel for exclusive excursions to virgin islands that are off-limits to regular tourists. It will be slightly expensive but im sure totally worth it. 

For diving check with local diving outlets (scattered all over the island)....the diving spots are different and it take place early in the morning when the waters are absolutely calm.

A very popular outing,Neofelis,"London, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,01-Dec-15,"Elephanta beach is a very popular outing for most tourists visiting Havelock. Hence, unsurprisingly the place is quite busy with a lot of boats arriving and a lot of tourists on the beach. The beach itself is fairly small and very neat and tidy. There is some fruit vendors on the beach but that is the extent of what you can get here to eat which is great since it ensures that beach goers don't leave much rubbish behind and the beach is maintained nice and clean. There are some water sports available on the beach itself like jet ski hires and banana boats for those interested. There is also a fringe reef right off the beach where some snorkelling is organised. This is where it gets interesting. The snorkelling is this rather strange experience where whoever you are, one is forced to wear a life jacket, and to get inside a round orange floating tube for safety and then be dragged out into the sea by a local guide for 10-15 mins. You can't really swim out on your own without a guide. We had our own gear and know how to swim etc but had to do it this way.

This can be very annoying to anyone who has snorkelled before and wants to snorkel in the regular sense of the word. But it serves a couple of important purposes: 

1) it is designed in a way that literally anyone can do this and enjoy a view of he fish down there. All you really need to know how to do is literally just hang on to the floatation tube and the guide does the rest. You just occasionally peak in the water. 

2) it ensures that all the tourists are well ""guarded"" at all times and no one is sillily trying to nick coral or disturb sea life. It is an intensely regulated operation by design. So helps protect this really heavily visited reef so well. And one can still see so many fish there despite the number of people constantly in the water. 

3) lastly it ensures that the people coming here to just experienced snorkelling for the sake of it are concentrated in one beach/one section of a reef. Leaving almost every other fringe reef tourist free and very well preserved for for the more interested divers and snorkellers.

The place offers complimentary snorkelling - a wonderful experience. 
When you start your journey, they would ask you for booking the ""Sea Walk"" prior to the journey.

Toilet is there on the beach. even swimwear to hire. the boat ride fare includes 10-15 mins snorkeling but it's very close to th beach and you will get to see only the dead corals.

if you go to the trail head which starts just off the road its a whole other story. FIRST - this trail is VERY VERY muddy trying to get down in flip flops will be almost impossible. There are branches and mud all over the steep trail. Make sure you are prepared for this. Also, once you are at the bottom there is no amazing beach. in fact there is a very small strip of sand and thats all. If you go left at the bottom of the trail you will come to the area where the boast are and can have a snack. If you walk straight out you will see a boat anchored.

Various water sports available on payment-water jet ski scooter and snorkeling is worthwhile, About 35 mins by motor boat(Rs 750 per head for return journey-includes complimentary snorkeling for about 20 mins each at Elephanta) from the Jetty at Havelock Island,Better to start around 8-9am from Havelock so that you reach Elephanta Island ahead of the main crowd and can do the water sports peacefully.You can get swim/beach wear(Rs 50) and on rent at Elephanta, Non swimmers can hire floating tubes.Snorkelling beyond the complimentary can be done for unlimited time by hiring snorkel set(Rs 150).Return trip to Havelock has to be done in the same boat used for the initial ride- within three hours of arriving at Elephanta.Enroute and just short of Elephanta is the site for Sea Walking-groups of 6-8 persons with helmets with compressed air attached to the mother boat are taken down to the sea bed at a depth of 6 metres and walk around (Rs 3200-3500 per head).Swimming is not required.Worthwhile if one is not doing scuba diving at Havelock/Port blair.

We carefully listened to the instruction and executed it. All beginners, needs to sincerely follow their instruction. Fear & excitement, may leads to forget their instruction. Hence maintain cool & calmness. Go with decent dress wear, not necessary for a swim suit though. Any light or white based dresses came well on the photo's taken under the water. While in under water, we need to breath heavily & frequently, so that the water level won't get increased in the helmet which covers us. You should do head movement rather eye movement while inside the water. Nice experience, post the sea walk, you may get ear pain, but would go after couple of hours. Most enjoyable one for around 15-20 Min. Those who are going with Kids, be careful to watch for their comfortness. No girl trainer available inside water, all are male trainers, which was felt uncomfortable some of our group members. We also did the Banana ride in the beach, were we went into deep water and got pushed into deep water with life jacket. So scary.. be aware of this and decide to go or not.

We kept on hearing the boats and jets go by spoiling the majestic atmosphere. Even the fish were few as it was unpleasant. 

Elephant beach is amazing and rather long and I appreciate the water sports availability there. However, I am suggesting to the boats carrying people there to make two stops. Take the people who want quiet and snorkeling to that point, and put the water sports on the other side of the beach.

Easy to get away from the crowds!,Parosite,"Paros, Greece",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,04-Apr-15,"I frankly don’t see the point why anybody would take an expensive boat trip to get to Elephant beach. The public bus to Radhanagar will drop you at the trailhead for a few rupees. The walk down to the beach can easily be done in flip flops in dry weather (might get muddy after rain) and crosses one of the nicest rainforests in the Andamans, featuring some true forest giants. You rarely see trees this size anywhere. Consider the tides though, as you will have to cross a swampy area just before you get to the beach. The murky water can be more than knee deep during high tide and the swamp can be completely dry at low tide. The landscape when you hit the beach is otherworldly, bizarre dead trees backed by turquoise waters. Turn left along the beach if you seek the crowds of day trippers who all stay in the same small area. If you turn right or carry on past the crowds you can enjoy the beach in complete solitude. The snorkelling is quite good for the Andamans, especially if you head for the far right or left of the beach. 
Some people I met managed to walk from Elephant Beach to Radhanagar at low tide, crossing some headlands on trails. I haven’t done it myself but it sounds really tempting (took them 5 hours). More",Feb-15
Hyped,SerendipityIndia,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,03-Apr-15,"We visited Elephanta beach as part of our ferry to Seawalk but the place is overhyped. If you want to do some water sports like Jet Ski (Rs. 600 per person), then it might be worth it but otherwise it is very crowded. Operators will try to sell the free snorkelling at the Elephanta beach as a catch to get you there, but it is controlled 10 minute publicly shared (And probably infected) snorkel that they will give you. 

The beach obviously is quite pretty. There are a few vendors which will sell fruits or chips or bhelpuri to you. 

Ofcourse there are no elephants on the elephant beach (At least we did not see any). 

Must do Seawalk on the way to Elephant Beach. It is super easy, even for people who are non-swimmers or afraid of water (Both of which are true for me). It feels so natural underwater that you will be wowed. Be treated to some great pics of your dive on a CD later. Well worth the booking. Videos to be paid extra.

The access to this beach is either through a 15-20 min speed boat ride or an hour and a half trek. The beach is beautiful. 
There are a few reefs very close to the beach which is why Snorkeling and Under Sea walk is feasible. The under sea walk is a one of a kind experience for people who are scared to go diving. Snorkeling is as easy as it gets and anybody can do it whether they know swimming or not. These two activities are something that you won't get in most of the beaches in India and would suggest these to anybody visiting this beach. 
The other water sports include jet ski, banana boat, and a lot of other high speed water rides.. 
There are also a few food stalls where they sell fruits. Most of the fruits are grown in Havelock which came as a pleasant surprise.

we arrived quite early at 8:30 there when there were 2-3 people on beach and put our bedsheet , bag in one corner to rest. 

the water was very calm so did swimming for more than an hour.my husband did snorkelling and there were lots of fishes that we saw specially the big parrot fish and damsel family fish . 

there are lot of water sports on the beach like banana ride, jet ski , it spoils the ambience of beach , polluting both water and env. 

there are few vendors on beach selling coconut water , fruits biscuits or you can carry few for yourselves . the beach closes by 3 pm so you have to return back by 2 .

The water is clear and you can see beatiful marine life just snorkelling. the beach is not very clean though. Wonder how the forest department cleans the place up! Any disposal procedures for the junk that is taken in by visitors and also some of the stuff that is peddled there. 
I say the officials confiscate some liquor from some visitors - though there were no signs which said 'No Drinking' and did not even provide a receipt for confiscated items. In fact some of these officials were overjoyed at having a party that evening.

Decent beach with good water sports option..,SandeepJana,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,15-Feb-15,"Elephanta beach is the nearest beach to Havelock that provides you with the opportunity to do some water sports. 

Like rest of the places in Andaman, here too the activities are more or less okay and that is one thing in which these islands need a lot of improvement. 

To reach this place you have to board a steamer from Havelock jetty which speeds up the water at a brisk pace and throughtout for your stay in Elephanta the steamer driver is your guide, sports instructor etc and you are bound to that boat and need to come back in the same boat. 

The beach itself is very beautiful with crystal clear blue water, white sand and fallen trees giving a majestic feel. The beach itself is quite small in area so gets quite crowded so one needs to wander a bit. 

I dont know if it was because of our tour package or in general, the time provided by your steamer guide on the beach is quite less.

Overpriced place for water sports and sea bed walking,Photosynthetix,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,03-Feb-15,"This is the place where one can do many water sports activities like snorkeling, sea bed walking, jet ski and banana boat rides etc. However, the beach lacks infrastructure like hygienic changing rooms. What they have right now in the name of ‘Eco changing rooms’ are door less chatai cabins, where uncivilized tourists pee, because the toilet is far away and chargeable (Rs 10 per person- seems that is too high for people). The changing room thus smells of urine. It’s absolutely disgusting. It is so disappointing to note that travellers who shell out Rs 3500 per head for a sea bed walking, can’t get a decent changing room or a clean life jacket. There is no shaded waiting area for patrons so during rain everyone squeezes under the temporary sheds selling water sports tickets. There are no shops to buy water or snacks, one has to carry everything, especially if one is travelling with kids. Its advisable to carry own snorkelling tube, swimming costume and towels and a set of dry clothing to change. The seabed walking experience was nice but the qualities of pictures are not good at all. Its not worth the money charged. More",Jan-15
Go to radhanagar and jolly buoy instead,AnkitaK16,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,03-Feb-15,"This place is similar to north bay and jolly buoy island. You can reach this place via a short boat trips from the jetty where you can do snorkeling, glass bottom boat ride to see the underwater marine life. Here additionally they have water sports too. The beach itself is nothing to boast about, radhanagar is much much better. And for snorkeling the best place is jolly buoy, this place is nothing compared to jolly buoy. As for water sports though they looked tad bit better than the ones offered at port Blair in Andaman water sports complex. The prices here were almost double compared to port Blair. So in conclusion though the place is not bad on its own but everything this place offers can be better done somewhere else More",

Nice beach but very crowded,Nisha I,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,01-Feb-15,"First tip i would like to give is that you should do the trek to this beach instead of going by ferry. Its a 2 km moderate level trek. One can even take a guide who will lead the way there and get you back. Though its a simple way but one has to navigate 200m of mangroves with ankle/knee level water if you reach after 10 am. 

The beach is beautiful and clean but very crowded with tourists pouring in. Its popular for its water sports and sea walk but please dont waste time on snorkeling at this point. Would be better to do it elsewhere in Havelock.",Jan-15

We were travelling as a family in the range of 3 to 65.We had signed up for Sea walk. Initially it was a bit intimidating. But the divers were very good & they took us down after the oxygen helmet was put on. They held our hands & escorted us all along. They were always checking if we were comfortable. Showed us the corals, feed fish so that we got a closer look & took pictures for us. It was an out of the world experience!!! 
I would recommend everyone to take Sea Walking in Havelock. 
Regarding the Elephanta Beach...its amazing....the white sand...blue sky & green sea...takes your breath away.

Unfortunately nobody seems to have an interest to control what is happening there despite all the talk about natural protection.

"Beautiful Beach, Snorkeling? Not really.",Chrissy B,"New York City, New York",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,09-Jan-15,"We visited Elephant Beach for snorkeling. I was not aware that ""snorkeling"" at Elephant Beach means that you are allowed to float around on a tube with your face in the water while a guide pulls you. You are allowed to put your mask in the water of course but you are not allowed to actually swim. Furthermore, the snorkeling is in a very confined space - maybe 50x50 feet. I was lucky enough to see a school of very large parrot fish and a couple smaller fish but corals are bleached out. I'm sure this used to be a very beautiful little reef but the close proximity of the boats docking near the reef have damaged the reef. We were able to rent snorkeling equipment on the beach for $300 rupees per item and go out a little on our own a little bit so that was nice. 

Once we finished snorkeling, we walked down the beach a bit from everyone and it was so beautiful and relaxing. I was able just to float in the relaxing waves of the cove and take in the amazing scenery. 

Given a choice I would search out other options for snorkeling but I did enjoy just relaxing on the beach. More",Dec-14

lot of water sport activities were there, like jet ski, banana ride, sofa ride… 

its a snorkeling place, where we ll be very safe with an accompanying swimmer who takes you around corals, need not worry of any kind of predators as snorkeling area was secures with nets… and also security officials will be there who work dedicatedly, once we cross the safe water border they'll blow whistle and alert us to come back… 

snacks like bhel poori, masala chats will be available, fruits are also available, but a bit costlier to main havelock island, as everything here have to be transferred by sea… 

sea walk can also be done here, under expert guidance which wil be a life time experience to go near coral life and even touching them with out harming …

NICE BEACH - BUT WASHROOM TO BE BUILT & Maintained !!,Ashutosh D,"Pune, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,20-Nov-14,"ELEPHANT BEACH ! 

-- Amazing trip to elephant beach from Havelock by a small speedboat -- they give you 3 hrs to enjoy and have to finish all your water activities in those 3 hours ! 

Pros: 
cristal clear water, you can see few nice fishes without even snorkling. 
under sea walk - is a must do activity -- try to get it in package while booking the whole trip - it'll be cheaper , otherwise its 3200 per person ! 
very safe and normal breathing technique.. very nice experience touching the clawn fish,rocks,feeding bread to fishes,and see all the aquirium fishes(Findin nemo) live touching your hands....Thanks to diver abhijeet for taking us to this amazing trip. 

CONS: 
WASHROOMS are not good at all, infact they are just not there.... you need to go in open jungle :( Not at all worth when you actually make so much money from this beach. -- should be made privatised and maintained by law for those who own these speedboats !

On some enquiry from the locals we found out that this place is known for snorkelling and sea walking. So we got our own snorkelling sets for 800 each.(available from main market of Havelock). And we decided to track our way to the beach. There is a huge chance that you might get lost so its recommended to take a ferry from Havelock jetty. They charge 750 per head. However we went trecking and were amazed by the experience. You must visit this place. Snorkeling is free if you go by ferry.(its inclusive in 750) and if you go on your own with your own snorkells then...the sea is all yours. 3200 is the price for sea walking, very easy to do, fun and lots of fishes, totally worth the money.

The snorkeling here is awful because the guide never let's you do it by your own and you can't go more than 100 meters away from the shore. The beach becomes too crowded because there are always more than 50 people in the 100 meters stretch available. This beach is good for a trip with kids but not good for snorkeling.

"""Best trekking experience and sea walk""",Hale1000,"Trivandrum, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,06-May-14,"At Havelock, each beach has a unique feature. Adventure lovers will definitely like elephanta beach. We had an amazing trekking experience, about 35 minutes through real forest.We used the help of a guide.Would recommend that since the route is not easy and also has snakes( Rs 200 guide charge). Beach is very beautiful with transparent blue water.Go before noon.By noon water sports will close down. No food malls or shops seen.Carry enough water.(coconut water available).Tried sea walking here. Was a life time experience. Both of us are non swimmers. Still enjoyed it much. Al together a half day visit would be enough Cons: They just give 2 minutes brief and send you down water. The so called eco friendly changing rooms are horrible ,with not even a door. Pros: Very nice experience with lots of fishes. Could touch few corals also. And photos came out very nice giving us memories to preserve for a life time. More",Apr-14
Good for water sports and a lovely trek,anujmehta10,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,02-May-14,"The beach has to approaches first the boring way : catch a speed boat from the jetty and spend around 15 minutes to reach this place stuffed with other people on board, second the exiting one : drive to the trek point which is just before the radhanagar beach and trek for around 35 minutes through a dense jungle with all those horrifying insect and bird noises and then finally walk through the water logged mangroves for about 10 minutes to reach this place. 

The feeling would be of success if you have made your trek, beleive me its not difficult as wrongly told by some people around, I did it with my wife and 3 yr old daughter. Do not hire a guide. 

Very exiting jungle with no one around you, we spotted 3-4 snakes beautiful green in color. No dangerous animals... Go ahead!!! 

While on the beach you can do the water scooter, sea walking, snorkeling etc... more for the female members and children to enjoy these safe water sports if they miss on there diving parts. More",Apr-14

The water is very clear, we had snorkeling (300) - I found it almost same as jolly buoy. I did scooter ride (600) - expensive that port blair rate of 350/- but this is a much beautiful place and sea walking (3200) - I understand it was an experience of a life time (its truly is) - though costly. 

The beach is scenic, you can easily click 100's of photographs. We took speed boat (1500 per person and one boat can only take 4 at a time) and it was better than scooter ride. 

I will say best time spent, marginally better than Radhanagar beach, More",Apr-14

Good place to visit,sid833,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,18-Apr-14,"been there in February of 2014 been there twice in fact loved the trek up to the beach i suggest every one to walk up to the beach which takes about 20 mins one way and is very easy no need of a guide. 

but too many people go there everyday which is really hurting the marine life up there the corals are very close by and most of them are dead corals. locals are trying to make money out of every activity. i got my own snorkel kit and went for a swim for as long as i wanted and it was really beautiful thanks to my under water camera i could make a video of it. i wish people were a little sensible towards fishes and corals would have been much better then. 

still a must vist beach and mind you there are no elephants here. More",Feb-14
Lubed the water activities :),MayurikaP,"San Jose, California",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,17-Apr-14,"So the best thing about this beach is you have to trek a lil, cross a bit of muddy mangrove and then water all over :) 

Well I know swimming and got my own snorkling gear but I was kind of scared of going deeper so I landed up rentin a tube and then I snorkled by my own happily for lonnng tym. 
other than this we did jet ski for once. 

We skipped the sea walk since we already did scuba diving the previous day. 

The water is enjoyable for long time with small fishes around you. 

I would suggest if u you have time then instead of taking boat from jetty to elephanta please prefer the walking route to enjoy the nature at its best. More",
Elephant beach,tkrisnadas,"Chennai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,17-Apr-14,I visited elephant beach in havelock during my visit to andaman recently.The weather was gorgoeus and sunny and the water was crystal clear. The beach sand was pure white. The island is inhabited only during the day time when the tourists visit. The highlights were the giant trees that have fallen over the beach and which were mesmerizing; if one cant snorkel or swim you could just hang on to the branches and just float away; i could see fishes along with me near the shore itself. You could just lay in the beach all day long. There is a nearby stream with fresh water where you could clean the salt water off if you wish- they also sell fresh water. also all water sports activities are availa ble More,Dec-13

Get lost in the serenity,yssunil,"Singapore, Singapore",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,22-Feb-14,"I can call this one of the top 3 beaches of Havelock. The beauty of Havelock is each of these Radhanagar, elephant and Kala pathar beach is so diff in landscape that they offer their unique charm. Hence they are not comparable. 
After the boat fiasco the only option for the moment is to walk down the forest to the beach. Its a good 30 mins walk if u walk briskly else a min 40 min. You can park your bikes at the bus stop landmark on the radhanagar beach road and start walking. 
The beach is not very long and its a narrow stretch. The entire stretch has a lot of uprooted trees that offers fantastic photography opportunity. The water is clear and the reefs are shallow. 

Tips: 
1. At least accommodate 3 hours for the total trip. 
2. Make sure you plan your return by 5 pm. Else walking through the dark jungles is not much advised. 
3. Don't have many food vendors. So suggest carrying water/snacks. 
4. Carry your own snorkeling equipment or rent one in the town. Its quite worthy than opting for a snorkeling session there for 500 bucks. More",

We took a speed boat from Havelock Jetty to Elephant beach - the boat cost us Rs. 2500/- has snorkeling for all the five members included. 
I think the USP of the place is that one is able to sight corals very close to the beach hence this place is great for snorkeling and glass boat trips. Water sports just got added alongside. The Glass boat (glass is put at the bottom of the boat) experience was very good - the boat costs Rs. 200/- per person - one gets a very good visibility of corals and fishes.

1. DO NOT DO WATER SPORTS HERE. THE BEST PLACE FOR WATER SPORTS IS RAJEEEV GANDHI WATER SPORTS COMPLEX IN PORT BLAIR. 
2. The water quality, although good, is not as good as some other beaches in Havelock like Vijaynagar Beach or Radhanagar Beach. As mentioned, there is no sand on the beach either. 
3. The corals/marine life is non existent, SO, THERE IS NO POINT SNORKELING HERE. INSTEAD, DO IT AT JOLLY BUOY. 
4. The view is also just ordinary compared to some other locations in Andaman like Jolly Buoy. 
5. All this beach has left to offer is water sports, which are priced twice as compared to the water sports complex in Port Blair. More",Dec-13

It was well worth the money...we where lowered along with a group of about 10 below the water (not too deep and close to the shore) wearing traditional divers head gear and were escorted at all times with professional divers. We had the opportunity to see all kinds of colourful fish, touch the coral, even feed the fish at one point. The divers even took a photo of us which we got immediately afterwards when we got up to the boat:-) The only snags are there are no places nearby to eat and drink or get changed, go to the toilet.

Its only one answer for all questions: Elephant Beach. Unbelievably clean and safe water there. Snorkerling, scuba diving, sea walk, scooter ride, jetski, speed boat ride, surfing and all other kind of water sports are done here. If you are scare of these all? Do glass bottom boat ride. The only one negative side of this place is there is no food and deinking water available. So its better to bring food, water and all other needful with you as town is 45 mins far from sea way and no roads are to town from there. Thirsty people are are also advised to keep sufficient liquor with them. There is no change room available and you need to go inside the bushes for change, so be prepared for that.

But to our surprise! me and my wife had the best time at this beach which had a picturesque setting and serene atmosphere. After doing our Snorkeling activity, we spent more than 3 hours on the beach before we were compelled to as ours was among the only two boats left on the beach at around 2 pm...! Since we visited in 2nd week of July, hence number of tourists were pretty less and honestly that's what we want...less crowd and more tranquil.

Don't miss!!,JiteshPurkait,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,13-Jul-13,Its one of the popular beach where the colour of water changes with light. The view is breath taking. Its the best place for snorkeling and glass bottom boat ride. I loved and enjoyed both the activities thoroughly. The beach was rich in flora & fauna and the visibility of corals was stunning.

Good beach for Travelling.,Tarakishore,"Calcutta, West Bengal, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,08-Jul-13,"Elephant Beach, located at a distance of around 10 km from the market, is one of the most popular beaches in Havelock Island for day trips. Reaching this beach.

Place for water sports only !!,Simi_s01,Bangalore,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,25-Jun-13,"To reach here, you need to take a jetty and this is the place which provides you with all kinds of water sports ( jet skiing, snorkelling, Scuba Dive, Bumpy ride,Glass bottom boat ride etc). For scuba you need to book in advance through the resort you have stayed in. They generally give one day training before taking you inside. Snorkelling is an easier and much enjoyable option :) .. by paying some extra bucks you can ask the swimmer guide to take you further more inside to have an amazing view. 

Its advisable to carry your Mineral water and snacks as there is nothing available on the beach. When I say nothing .. it literally means ""NOTHING"". Other than the sports counters and one bhelpoori guy there were only tourists around. 

There are small cottage kind of area made up as Ladies Changing Room.There is no toilet facility on the beach. You get tubes which they charge on per hour basis. 

Its a very crowded kind of a place where people came in big groups jumping playing in water. So if you are looking for a peaceful secluded beach, this is not the place. 

It opens at 9:30 am and closes at 3:00 pm so make sure you reach on time or else you miss the water sports. More",Dec-12

Its just a huge pile of branches and corals that poke your feet! Also the facilities for snorkeling are chaotic, unclean and pathetic. I would definitely not recommend visiting this island. If you wish to snorkel go to North Bay island.",May-13

My first scuba experience,Vikram_Rawal,"Silvassa, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,06-Jun-13,"Will remember this place. Had my first scuba dive with Barefoot Scuba over here. And what an experience. Difficult to put it into words but that aquatic life is altogether a different world. Compared to it, snorkeling is just a dull trailer. You will also find some water sports in here and could indulge in it once you are through with you dive or snorkeling. Less crowd and worth a visit.",Feb-13

Best Beach in Havelock and one of the best in Andamans,Vanderlooster,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,18-May-13,"DO NOT MISS. 

If you have been to Havelock and returned without visiting this beach ... you've missed the best part of Havelock. Perhaps this is the perfect excuse to pack your bags again. 

This beach gave us bad sunburns, as none of us wanted to get out of the water and go to the hotel (Please carry your sunburn lotion). 

Snorkelling here is the best in Andamans. Speed Boats are the costliest (Rs 600 vs Rs 250 at Corbyn's Cove)",May-13

The best attraction of Havelock,abch,Bangalore,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,07-May-13,"Snorkelling here is amazing. The coral reefs, and the brilliant colourful tropical fishes make the trip to Andaman worth everything. Even if you dive here, do not forget to snorkel as well. The clarity while snorkelling is sometimes better than while diving. If you can, take a underwater camera with you to capture those brilliant sites.",Apr-13
Beautiful beach!,Bhawna L,Mumbai,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,02-May-13,"The beach itself is quite scenic with uprooted trees lining the coast and the clear turquoise waters. However, it tends to get very crowded later in the day. 
The beach provides for many water sports live water scooter, snorkeling etc. 
Can be visited on a half day tip from Havelock... 
Be careful where you book from, the market near the jetty provides options for a shared speed boat transfer. Our hotel tricked us into paying a huge sum for a trip to Elephant beach but after checking with other tourists at that beach, we realized we could have booked directly or through another travel agent instead of our resort.",Mar-13
Good for Snorkelling and Sea Walk,WhiteSandAndaman,"Port Blair, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,29-Apr-13,"This is a good place to visit when in the Havelock Island. 
For adventure lovers rent a two wheeler(around INR 400) and ride to the start of the Elephant Beach trekking trail. The trekking is mostly through the jungle, you can also enjoy the coast line. Don'f forget to carry water as it is a little humid in these islands. 

You can also visit the beach by taking a Dongi from the jetty(Havelock harbour) to the elephant beach. Upon reaching the beach, options for Snorkelling and Sea Walking are present. The water is very clear and a very nice place to snorkel. If you are lucky you might see Rajan ""The Elephant, who swims"" near you. More",Jan-13
Fun half day trip from Havelock town,Ramya_Ti,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,29-Apr-13,"Elephanta Beach is essentially a giant swimming pool =) The waters are light blue green , crystal clear and warm . To get to Elephanta beach , we took a package boat trip - which included an auto rickshaw pick up to and back to our hotel , the up and down boat ride and some snorkeling . We were told that the beach is approachable , only via water. The waters are lovely , but the beach itself is very small , usually crowded and dirty . By default - due to the reef , the clear waters and the proximity to the shore - we enjoyed the experience itself and saw myriad varieties of fish . We did have some problems - We went with Mr. Ranjit Kulla - the owner of the rickshaw and the boat , and his nephew . It was the nephew who took us snorkeling. he was absolutely unenthusiastic and not very helpful when we faced difficulty with the snorkeling gear . We were promised unlimited snorkeling - however that was not what we got . A couple quick forays , not too far from the shore and we were done. The guide did not give us any information on the fish either. The regulations he imposed on us also seemed a little odd - even though my boyfriend is a fantastic swimmer he was unwilling to let him swim without the tube...

I had a quick go on the water scooter for Rs 600. You are not allowed solo self drive , but it was a fun couple of minutes where you get to be privy to some daredevil antics at the end . There were also banana boat rides , water sofa rides and the sea walk available . There is no bottled water available and snacks are limited to fresh fruit , so bring your own food. There are no bathrooms either . 
There are floats and tubes available for rent for a nominal price . 
The trip was all in all about 4 hours and cost Rs 2600 . We found it to be fun , but would not consider it among the high points of the trip. Make sure you bargain with your guide and lay down clear conditions for the duration and terms of snorkeling .

Lovely and then crowded and busy,catherine014,bloomsbury london,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,26-Apr-13,We went on a Barefoot snorkel trip. It was great. The snorkelling was good (the next day on Inglis Island was better). The beach was beautiful. By around 10 am the beach was surprisingly busy with lots of big groups and lots of children being taught to swim in the shallows. It looked as though there are a lot of big boats which use this beach. There were a few speed boats also kind of ruining what had been a quieter experience. It was surprisingly busy. A great morning - really enjoyed it. Would do it again.,Mar-13
"huge swimming pool, great place for snorkelling",priyaravikanth,bangalore,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,20-Apr-13,"we went here for snorkelling, but the place was like a big swimming pool. not much of a beach but fun place. 
glass bottom boats are not bad either if you cant do snorkelling 
water activities are a lil expensive here.",Apr-13
Disappointing,L P,Cornwall,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,16-Apr-13,"Wasn't really worth the effort to get here although seeing the aftermath of the tsunami was interesting and thought-provoking. Weird that jet-skis and banana-boats are allowed here. Beaches 5 & 7 much nicer, stick to them for a beach day or take a snorkelling trip.",Apr-13
Excellent for snorkelling,SoumyanathC,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,14-Apr-13,"THis is one place where you can see corals by just snorkeling from beach. Water is calm here and you do not need any guide, but keeping one is good because they will take you at some excellent spot which you may miss. Excellent view of coral and fishes. 

Only bad thing is the water scooters. These tend to scare away the fishes. I think, water scooters should be banned near the corals.",Apr-13
Best snorkelling spot in Andamans,Suhas K,bangalore,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,11-Apr-13,"This beach is part of Havelock island which comes in between Radhanagar beach and Havelock boat jetty. But since approach road to the beach is only accessible through a 30 minute trek through forest the most preferred option is to rent a boat from Havelock jetty. For shutterbugs you will cross the small lighthouse near to jetty which gives great photo opportunity. You can get a fibre speed boat which can carry around 8 people for around 3000 INR. You need to check with boats which are anchored opposite to Barefoot restaurant near Havelock Jetty. The package is for to and fro boat ride plus snorkelling which the boat man or this assistant will assist you in. Do note that mid way in to snorkelling he will ask for 300 INR for taking you still further, I guess its their ploy to make more money. What to they do is they take you on a smaller circle and mid way if you ready to pay more they will increase the radius of the circle. So you basically see the same underwater life albeit for a bit longer. We told we are ready for paying the extra money and he took us around still further. Since the water is filled with different variety of fishes we didn't think twice on paying him more. However post trip what we made out was if we were having our own set of snorkel we...

Since the water is filled with different variety of fishes we didn't think twice on paying him more. 

However post trip what we made out was if we were having our own set of snorkel we could have viewed the sea life with as much as we would like. The sea is calm and since the current is pushing you towards the beach its we felt it would have been safe for snorkelling here without assistance unlike Jolly buoy island near Port Blair. 

From what I made out on discussion with locals the best way to visit Elephanta beach is through trek through the forest, while coming from Havelock market to Radhanagar beach you can find a mud road which forks out towards your right. There is a marking for this road which is near to Radhanagar police station, however I have heard its easier to make the trek in low tide since there is a stretch of mangroves you have to cross. 

Also, do plan your visit to Elephanta as early as possible (boatmen are ready to leave from 6AM) since this will help you beat the crowd and the sea will be calmer. There are water sports activities like Jet Skiing which you can do after getting tickets on beach, they charge around 600 INR for each ticket. There are changing rooms for Gents and Ladies also on the beach. 

The boat ride will take around 30 mins from Havelock Jetty and based on when you start you will be back to Havelock Jetty around lunch time. More",Mar-13

Great place for snorkeling,draman2000,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,06-Apr-13,"It's an ideal place to snorkel within India. The best way to get to it is by boat. Make sure you wear your swim wear in your hotel before leaving as the changing facilities are minimal. It's great to be able to just swim out of the beach and snorkel- you get to see a variety of marine life very close to the beach. All of us spent a good amount of time swimming and snorkelling- was very relaxing. We also enjoyed the jet skis and banana boat rides( bit expensive) 

Its a small beach and has very minimal facilities in terms of changing rooms and bathrooms ( none) Was sad to see it quite dirty around the change rooms. 
But overall it was worth the visit and we thoroghly enjoyed our time spent there. More",Feb-13
"Desolate, and certainly a trek",VixandPete,"London, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,05-Apr-13,"hmmmm, hard to describe this one, the trek is through the jungle, which my boyfriend enjoyed and I didn't find it too bad, although there are little lizards all over the floor so watch your step. Wouldn't advise doing this alone or before sunrise or around sunset. The trail is pretty straight forward although at certain parts you could take wrong turnings. 

After you reach the end of the trail you really do come out into mangrove swamps, which at low tide is fine as you just walk through them however I certainly wouldn't have been doing this when the tide was up, as its a little eerie. You will also see markers on trees, coloured ribbon etc its not a bad idea to keep a mental note of these to make sure you find your way to and from the beach. 

If your a bit of an explorer then this will be your kind of thing however if your a little nervous like me, then it's probably not for you. Make sure you bring mossie repellant with you too even if it is during the day as your walking through the jungle and don't wear flip flops like I did!!! More",Mar-13

All swim equipments (rubber tubes etc) available for rent. 
Its a small beach and gets fades by the afternoon .. So morning visit is the only optoin left. 

Coming to water sports. 
I would say, its the best of all places

Changing rooms are available.

Colourful fishes & weird thai pill bottles,RuusaTuomas,"Lahti, Finland",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,06-Mar-13,"Elephant beach has two ok reefs located on either side of the main beach: the one on the left seems to be bigger. There is some good snorkelling here, but best to get here early in the morning, before the crowds appear and scare away timid species such as the turtle. A trip here can be organized trough any guesthouse or a hotel, make sure your trip includes an afternoon stop at the lighthouse reef on the way back. On any given time species like the clownfish, parrotfish and anemone fish as well as turtles and several endemic species such as Andaman sweetlips can be seen on the reefs here+ a weird array of pill bottles and plastic washed ashore from Thailand and Myanmar. 

The actual beach was virtually washed away in the Boxing day Tsunami, but there is nice patches of sand here and there to recuperate on from reef exploring away from the main strech. There are snacks beeing sold on the beach as well as an operation offering jetski rentals and all sorts of annoingly noisy water activities.

There are few locals who assist in snorkeling/scuba so do not expect professionals. We were told that boat would take Rs 3k(bothways) from Havelock jetty. In morning there is one shared boat which charges Rs700 p.p. Since we had missed the sharing boat and 3k seems to be quite high so we dropped the idea to go there. However while going to Radhanagar beach we found a track to reach. We took the same and reached elephanta beach in 30 mins. After reaching there we were glad that we didnt spend 3k to reach there.

Snorkler's Haven,AjLud,"Coonoor, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,20-Feb-13,"Snorkling haven, Hathi-dera (Elephant-beach) lies a 45-min ""dongi""-ride away from beach No 1. You need not be prepared with snorkels and life-jackets; the dongi owner (your captain for the evening) will provide you with one. If you are very particular that what goes into your mouth hasn't been inside someone elses, buy yourself a snorkel at Port Blair for the visit to Haveleock (enough stores close to Aberdeen Jetty). 
A clear sunny day is absolutely essential for the colours of the coral and underwater life to come out alive. Get deeper (further from the beach) for better views. Upto about a 100-yards from the beach is safe enough (from the current point of view) and shallow enough to view almost everything. 
The guide that came along on the boat with you would possibly navigate you (also push you along since most visitors are dead sinkers!) from wading depth to about toe-touching depth and back. If you are comfortable in the water, use the guide's help and venture deeper for a view of your lifetime. More",Mar-12

It has clear water and a coral reef off it, so its good for snorkelling and diving. And since its located on Havelock which is a tourist hangout, this means it is rather commercial and crowded. 

You get coconut water and other refreshments here, but not many other facilities (in case you are expecting them). You can get here by trekking or by boat from the jetty at Village 3. We took a diving trip and ended up here, spent some time on the beach and then went back by boat. 

Certainly not a place for peace and quiet. If you are really interested in snorkelling, you can consider taking (albeit more expensive) a trip to another island like South Button or Inglis. Or come here on a boat, anchor off the beach and then depart when done. More",Feb-13

While coming back, we travelled by a vessel names ""Rangat"", which does not have A/C, we booked the expensive seat as ""Chair"" - which is in lower Deck, without A/C, TV, broken chairs.

Busiest Beach in Andamans,Hunt4Paul,"Pyin Oo Lwin (Maymyo), Myanmar",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,02-Dec-11,"This is where most foreign tourists to the Andamans come. The beach is several kilometers long with resorts and beach huts just back from it beneath coconut palms. 
The water is very shallow for quite a way out with dead coral to walk or swim over until reaching more interesting sites to snorkel. The water is very warm. 
The beach is frequented by battalions of Israelis especially during Jewish holidays. 
Small boats anchored at the beach can be booked at local resorts for snorkeling and scuba diving trips. 
There's plenty of shade beneath mangrove trees and coconut palms to relax away from the blazing, hot sun. 
Beware of falling coconuts which can crack skulls.",Nov-11

wonderful experience,DeviArchana,hyderabad,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,12-Mar-11,to reach havelock you have to take a boat from portblair. it takes around 2 and half hrs to reach havelock. I have been there for 2 days and its a wonderful experience. Havelok is an island with number of beaches. One can go for snorkeling and see a wide variety of fishes. The elephant beach is the best for snorkeling. radha nagar beach is next to none. i would advise to plan the trip on your own rather than taking a package. we have taken a package from Must See India and its a real waste. The agent Mr. Vidhan has not informed us about anything that we need to visit or see. He planned the trip in such a way that one whole day of ours got just got wasted. To go back to portblair from havelock we have two boats in the afternoon : one at 2:30 and the other at 4:30. better go with the 4:30 one so that you can spend enough time at havelock. More,Mar-11
Havelock islands where beaches are beautiful!,Worldtrip78,"Frankfurt, Germany",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,31-Jan-11,"Havelock Island is part of the Andaman Islands and is known for its pristine white sandy beaches and luxurious green forest. When we went for our holidays to this Andaman Island, not only did we enjoy the nature at its best, but it also gave us the opportunity to go snorkeling and scuba diving to discover the life under water as well. The waters around this Island are rich in corals and exotic marine life and you can get a close look at them by going snorkeling and scuba diving. You can explore and savor the island's sandy beaches and virgin forests in the day. A tour to the Havelock Island is exciting, relaxing and rejuvenating. More",Dec-10

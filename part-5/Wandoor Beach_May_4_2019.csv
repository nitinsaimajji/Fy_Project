Nice place,Karthik240087,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,05-Dec-18,This place is called the crocodile beach. Going inside the water is prohibited as salt water crocodiles are present in the area. You can take a stroll. Watch the sunset and wet your feet on the shores. There are no changing rooms there and restroom is pretty bad even for guys. Hence only for relaxing this beach would do good. You can take a stroll and by the beach side you will get a resort named sea princess where you can have some food with a view of the beach.,Dec-18
A decent beach,gogoipj,"Tinsukia, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,27-Nov-18,"There are a lots of fallen trees on the beach which adds unique charm to the beach. These trees are the remnants of destruction caused during tsunami. Sea is very calm, almost with no tide. Crocodile is an another threat at the beach although beach is decently longer and curvy in size and shape. The real beauty of the beach can be enjoyed when one move 200mts right of the market place. Visitors most often gather near the parking area, hence misses the best part of the beach. Marketing is cheaper but we have seen most people avoid marketting here. This beach is much much better then Cidiya Tapu and Munda Pahar beach located at same distance from Aberdeen bazar. More",Nov-18

Beautiful Blue Waters and Gorgeous Sand,Sidhant_Sharma,"Chandigarh, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,07-Oct-18,"Wandoor Beach is about 40 mins away from Port Blair, the road is good but has a few rough patches. The first thing you see when you enter the beach is the blue and pristine water. There have been instances of the crocodile being around the place so swimming is not allowed. I was told by the local police that in the first quarter of 2018 an European was eaten by a crocodile and hence the restriction in the water. However, my personal experience is that this should not deter you as the beach water is too good to miss on a trip there. Just go and relax have a beer along or take Fresh Coconut water. I Just took an isolated patch of sand far from tourists and laid there for 2 hours for relaxation. Must see beach. More",Sep-18

Wandoor is amazing place clean and clear water, you will see tides waves ups and down. Rock claiming around. They have small and motor boats to take you around. Good shops to eat on and super clean sand to play football Valley Ball. I have seen many people were doing there school and college picnic.

People of the place were awesome very coordinating and supportive.

We went to this beach . As this beach is far from the town so you need to have a plan to visit this place. Apart from natural beauty of the beach what I found here is , if you have 2-3 hours of time you can do a very good shopping. There are lots of shops which had variety articles and show pieces. We did our maximum shopping from here and found these shops to be even cheaper than the government shop. Apart from shopping there are good snacks options here. You may get Narial paani atleast in 5-6 colours. The colour of Lemon Tea and Normal Tea are different from the tea that you get in the market or home. This will attract you to have it to examine the taste. If the weather is cool you can easily spent 3-4 hours here. The shopkeepers and food sellers are very courteous . I would again advise to consider this place for Andman shopping. The shopkeeper even bargains upto 30%. More",Dec-17

If you’re the adventure junkie, then a short trek to the natural caves here is just the thing for you. The caves, formed over decades, have been carved by fierce high tides that surround the beach. The challenging trek is best taken up in the morning because the tides are low and you’re able to get back by early evening.

When water recedes, it becomes rocky-- like all other beaches. 
The difference of Wandoor with other beaches is that you see lots of uprooted trees- which reminds of Tsunami. These trees are deliberately left on the beach because it reminds people of the havoc of Tsunami, makes a good landscape and also offer themselves as resting places. 
My small daughter enjoyed this place a lot as she correlated ""Wandoor"" with some character that she maybe watching on TV. All through, she kept fighting with this wandoor and in the process accumulated a lot of armoury in form of sticks and so.

We did have a bit of discomfortt with a group of dogs lurking around us constantly and nipping at our heels, probably used to handouts by visitors who come here. 

Despite this, its worth a visit as its not one of the more frequented ones. Also do make it a point to hop over to Jolly Buoy - has some interesting diving and fairly clear water. More",Dec-14
Give it a pass,AjLud,"Coonoor, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,01-Mar-15,"As a beach, Wandoor has nothing special. 
Wandoor lies in a shallow cove, where water-level varies drastically with the tide - what is visible is a wide beach and a narrow beach. The beach is still lined with dead trees from the tsunami of 2004 - a stark reminder of nature's fury. 

The sand is smooth - almost clayey. Would do well as a mud-pack; dry yourself on the beach and then wash it off. 

There's no marine life in the waters here, not even marine plant life. 

Hutments have sprung up because of the tourism boom. A lot is available in terms of services. The natural beach did not offer so much.",Apr-14

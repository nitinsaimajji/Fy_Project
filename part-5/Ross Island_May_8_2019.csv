Very nostalgic place to spend a good time,GlobeTrottersClub,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,07-May-19,We went towards the evening and our children thoroughly enjoyed watching the numerous deers and peacocks in the open.

Amazing Light and Sound show,AP1729,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,28-Apr-19,"In my opinion the best time to go there is in the evening. I went to Ross island from Port Blair.

They let you explore there for an hour.The island has a lot of ruins from the british era as well as a beach, a pond and a monument to sailors. If you are going in the morning take enough water from Port Blair. I went at around 10.30 am and it was quite hot. However, the best time to go is not in the morning, but rather in the evening. There is a light and sound show at Ross island at 4.30 pm. Tickets must be bought from the Andaman tourism department office for Rs100 per person. Apart from this, one must book a ferry for Rs300 and also pay island fee of Rs 30. I went twice- once in morning and evening and would recommend going in evening only. Not only would you save money, but you will have a much better experience. It is best to get on the first ferries which starts at around 4pm to spend maximum time on Ross island before the start of the light and sound show. The island is quite empty in evening and you...

The island is quite empty in evening and you can see all deer,rabbits and peacocks running around which were not there in the morning. Further, the island is cooler and so easier to walk around. Lastly, the light and sound show is of a very high production value with lots of famous names working on it (like Gulzar,Shabana azmi , resul pookutty etc). I felt it was much better than the one at Cellular Jail. More",Apr-19

Historical glimpse to the islands....,Hope T,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,07-Apr-19,"Situated approx 2 km east of Port Blair. It was the location of British administrative set up the ruins of which can be seen scattered on the island.

Going sequentially, you have to get on a boat from jetty which is a return journey. it can be only ross island vis or combined with the north bay coral reef - a loc for water sports. you get arnd an hour on the island at teh end of which your boat picks you up for water sports or jetty, as per your deal. 
At the outset you can see the japanese bunker after which you enter the island proper on purchasing the ticket from the counter. You have an option of oing solo around the tracks or taking guided tours on electric carts. Ruins of administrative and military set up can be seen along the tracks which are explained by the boards placed next to the ruins. Most of the buildings are damaged by tsunami or engulfed by vegetation. Also, wildlife on the island mesmerizes you with who keep moving about the island oblivious of the visitors.

Stunning blue water views and the British grandeur,dhoomketu,"Hyderabad, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,31-Mar-19,"We had a memorable family vacation in Andaman islands. We covered Port Blair, Swaraj Dweep (Havelock), Shaheed Dweep (Neil) and Netaji Subhash Island (Ross). We were disconnected from the world with no mobile connection (except in Port Blair) and no data connection, and still we did not miss anything. On day 1 we took a flight from Hyderabad to Port Blair. Port Blair is a small city with hilly terrain, and ocean on almost all sides. It has a small airport with landing and take-off only in one direction i.e. from and to south. A new terminal building is coming up in view of growing traffic, and possibly international connections. We had booked right side window seats for all four of us in advance in the Indigo flight so that we could see the islands during the descend.

People in Port Blair are soft spoken and helpful. One reason could be that they understand the need to help each other in a small island. We had booked only the hotel and the cruise to Swaraj Dweep and Shaheed Dweep. For transfer to the hotel from airport we took a cab at the airport itself. There is a pre-paid taxi booth near baggage claim manned by Port Blair traffic police. We got a cab for Rs 150, outside the terminal it would have cost 200-300. On the way to the hotel the cab driver suggested us to visit Ross island that very day. So we dumped our bags at the hotel and rushed to the Aberdeen jetty. We got the first glimpse of a stunning blue water, something I had never seen before. 

We hopped on to a ferry from there to go to Ross island now renamed Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose island. Netaji visited this island in 1945. Though Ross is a small island it has its own history. First settlement was in 1788 and then abandoned in 1796. It was settled again after 1857 and remained headquarter of British rule in Andamans until 1941, when it was captured by Japanese. It came under control of the Government of India 1945. 

As you enter the island there is a Japanese bunker who built it during their occupation of the island during WW II. Island has the ruins of a typical British colony, full with colonial buildings of English grandeur. It has barracks, hospital, church, club and so on. Over the time the trees have embraced the buildings, and thus protecting whatever remains of the ruins for posterity. Modern filmmakers must have got a lot of ideas from such places. 

By the way there are plenty of Indian spotted deer on the island. There is also a water purification plan with long pipes to convert sea water into drinkable water. 

We further trekked into the north of the island to reach other end where there is a jetty leading to a light house. View from there was absolutely stunning. 

There are also facilities for water sport here but we ran out of time. 

Evening we visited the bazaar near the clock tower in Port Blair. Being Sunday most of the shops were closed, but we could pick some bakery items for the morning. 

Recommendations - Cost of boat ride was Rs 350 per head. Last boat leaves from the Aberdeen jetty at 2 pm, so make sure to be there as early as possible so that there is sufficient time at the island. Do not waste money on cabs. Take autos, scooters and remain free. It is much cheaper, will help you explore and also allow you to interact with local people. Everyone speaks Hindi there and if you know Bangla, even better.

Great place to relive history,allanlakra17,"Ranchi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,07-Mar-19,"A ferry ride to Ross Island from Water Sports Complex jetty would cost Rs. 350 per head for to and fro journey. Remember, the ferry that takes you there would bring you back, no one else. You also have the option of getting into a shared battery rickshaw which would give you a tour of the island. However, we could not obtain a seat after 2 or 3 attempts and then decided to explore the place on foot. That was a good decision. The times when the island was inhabited must have been a paradise. Despite loathing the times when we were ruled by the British, you can't help but admire their sense of planning. In late 1800 they planned a swimming pool filtering sea water. They had made distilleries to provide drinking water to the inhabitants. The cathedral, though in ruins, still stands majestically. And the icing on the cake was, wild deers and peacocks loitering freely in the open. It must have been a great place to live in those times. We were informed by a local that because of Ross Island, Port Blair was least affected by the tsunami in 2004. It bore most of the brunt and saved Port Blair from major damage.

Awesome - An abandoned city !!!!!,KSNAR,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,01-Mar-19,"Let me begin this review by saying that Ross Island ( renamed as Netaji Subash Chandra Bose Island by Honourable PM of India ) was instrumental in saving the city of Port Blair from the ghastly Tsunami of December 2004. 
This place is hardly two kilometres from Port Blair Aberdeen Jetty. Ross Island is actually an abandoned city, built ( and abandoned ) by the British. You could see ruins of everything that makes up a city. There is Commissioner's Bungalow, Church, Power Plant, Cemetry, Barracks etc. All this in a very small area that can be effectively covered walking. The path is hilly and is not advisable for the elderly and infirm. However, electric battery operated vehicles are there for assistance. You find lovely deers roaming around in the open, freely mingling with humans, and eating whatever is offered to them. There are few peacocks that add to the attraction. You need to walk down a steep path to go the beach on opposite side of the beach where you landed by boat. You can spend whole day in this island, if you are really interested in history and old ruins. Boat guides hassle you and try to get you out of the island in maximum 2 hours. There is a small shop dispensing popular items like Lays, Coke, Frooti, Mineral Water etc. 
Certainly worth a visit.

Ruins worth a capture,AnuMohit,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,01-Mar-19,"From port Blair it’s a tiny boat ride for INR 350 each!

The entry ticket is minimal and you have the option to walk across the entire place (make a note it gets very hot) or take a golf cart ride. The golf cart ride is a 8 seater and the driver charges INR 80 per person , one has the option to book the entire cart and be flexible or wait for 8 passengers. The place is a photographers treat. The history behind the ruins are worth learning. Like many other places, due to irresponsible tourists it’s not very well kept, plastic bottles and packets thrown here and there.

You can see spotted deer and pecocks there. You can take pictures with them. Just a small request that please dont feed them, and if you are feeding deers please feed them with your bare hands, and dont litter around as deers eat the left over wrappers and that can affect their health.

Deer and rabbits!,Traveller_Ind644,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,12-Feb-19,"Ross Island was the older British capital of Andaman and right now, everything is in ruins. The natural beauty however is amazing, both on the island and around it. There are very old trees with roots spread all over and blue water all around. 
Our trip to the whole of Andaman, including Havelock Island was arranged by Ms. Monisha and her team at Pristine Andaman (pristineandaman@gmail.com). We booked air travel and hotels on our own. All the rest (ferry/speed boats/transfers from airport, hotel, etc./permits/divers) were managed by them. They reserve hotels too but we came to know of them only after we had already done that. They have a complete chain. So basically after landing in Portblair, you don't have to worry about anything. They will design a package and ask you for your comments and the itinerary can be tweaked as per your preference/ convenience. Charges for water activities are your own, depending on what you want to go in for. They are quite flexible and considerate of your needs. A very high level of coordination wherein they assure you that the driver will call you before you land at a place and the driver actually does that! Strongly recommended. More",Feb-19

After waiting for an hour, it came and we were not permitted to board as it was reserved for a group. A dock coordinator came and wrote out a new ticket for ""OB Sea Liner"" which came in 15 minutes to collect 5 foreigners and 3 locals. 
Arrived on island at 10:10 AM and given instructions to re-board at 11:20 AM. We walked the island circuit; to the bakery, up to the church, to the cemetery, down to the market, reviewed all the signage before the more organized return to Port Blair on the ""OB Sea Liner'.

Lovely small Island.Get to be with hundreads of deers/peacocks and rabbits,sangishan,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,30-Jan-19,"I enjoyed my trip to Ross island with my family recently in Jan 2019. 
Right from the Water sports complex to board the jetty till Ross island and return ,everything was perfect .The only regret was that I got only 45 minutes to see the island. 

Ross is a small island. The ruins are there ,and worth seeing. But what I found to be a unique experience was that in Ross hundred's of tame deer's roam about in the open. Initially you will be able to get close to them ,but if you are patient and gentle you can actually touch them. This is a magical experience. 
That apart there are tame white rabbits and plenty of peacocks. 
I took the evening boat to Ross that leaves at 4pm for the light and sound show. Since the boat got delayed I could not spend enough time .At least an hour and a half is required if one wants to experience ross in its entirety and this does not include the time for the light and sound show. 
I found the light and sound show at Ross to be very good .It is definitely worth seeing .Much better than the light and sound show at Cellular Jail. 
Do not miss Ross during your Andaman visit. You will enjoy it. If you have kids ,it is an absolute must. More",Jan-19

The deer are very friendly and don't mind being petted. They expect to be fed, despite the boards which warn you against it.

Super fun place for all,Indianpopcorn,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,15-Jan-19,"Visited Ross island with my family. Chose to visit in the evening for the famous light and sound show. Here's what I think of the place: 
1. The place itself is quite beautiful. It was a township that was deserted after a massive earthquake divided the island in the middle. What is left is heartbreaking ruins of an era gone by. Church, commissioner's bungalow, barracks...all are beautiful and I loved visiting those. 
2. For the young ones, the place offers an unequalled experience of walking with the deers. The place is brimming with deers and rabbits. And you can even feed them ( with permission from the caretaker). Both my kids LOVED it. 
3. The light and sound show is very well produced and professionally curated. I have not seen an equivalent show in India so far. To top it all, gulzar's story telling transports you to a different world. Mesmerizing is the only word. 

All in all, a visit to Ross island is a must. Do not miss it More",Jan-19

Brutal British History in Ruins,Krish1965,"Chennai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,03-Jan-19,"Now known as Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Island, Ross Island is a painful reminder of the British Raj. Named after the Captain Daniel Ross who was a hydrographer employed by the East India Company is still wonderful as the tossing waves, the blue waters, tall coconut trees and the silver beach haven't changed a little. 
A boat ride of about 10 minutes would take you from the Port Blair and one can see a colony in it's ruins. British Officers used to stay there and on coming to know of the execution of an Indian freedom fighter from the Cellular Jail (Guantanamo Bay of the British Raj), parties would begin in the tiny islands then. 

It is a natural beauty unparalleled lulled by the inhuman history. A person who loves his nation and humanity has to go around the island with a heavy heart as nearly thousand patriots fell to the gallows still preserved in their finest cruel history. Cruelty was at its best display and hence the sad narrative. But, yet again I reiterate the entire Andaman Islands group is one of the rarest,still with it's pristine beauty.

The Island was the Capital of the Brits during their time in the Andamans. The history of the place is beautifully depicted by a Son et Lumiere, which is of EXTREMELY HIGH QUALITY. It brings the island alive in its depiction of the life spent by the British. There are plenty of spotted deer and rabbits on the Island, who roam around absolutely freely and are extremely friendly. A couple of golf carts are available which can be used to go around the island. The island is extremely small and can be gone around in an hour and a half. Most of the old buildings are in ruins. There are adequate boards which depict the history of the Island, which are on display if one wants to skip the Son et Lumiere. Though the Son et Lumiere is a must see. A MUST VISIT ISLAND.

Later on, the prisoners built houses, barracks, offices and other structures. 
This island is a 15 mins ride from Aberdeen jetty. You will have to buy entry tickets and if one can't walk, you can take a buggy ride. 
My suggestion would be to walk, there are several places to sit if one gets tired and you can explore the island and take pictures.

There is no beach or swimming activities in this island. You need at least 2 hours to go around this island. But normally the boats allow only 1:30 hours. Unfortunately our boat driver cheated us and allowed only around 50 minutes and we could not see much. It appears that the ticketing agents and ferry operators are different. Ticketing agents inform it is 1.5 hours trip. Upon reaching the island boat operators give us only one hour time and they say they are not responsible for the promise made by the ticketing companies. Around 10-15 minutes are wasted in getting the slot to stop the boat as there is space constraint and many boats come at the same time.

Great experience,Shalini S,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,05-Jul-18,"Ross island is located opposite the Marina in Port Blair. One has to take a tourist ferry to reach it. 

The island was at one time the seat of British administration for Andman while Port Blair was the penal settlement. One can see the ruins of the British buildings like barracks, shops, church, swimming pool etc. There is a Japanese bunker also constructed during the Japanese occupation. 

There's a small beach. Also there are some deers and peacocks which fascinate the children. The deers are quite friendly and come quite close to people 

A part of the islands was damaged during an earthquake forcing the British to shift. Later the tsunami lashed the island. 

A sound and light show is organised every evening except Wednesday. It's worth watching as one learns about the history of the islands. The Hindi show has narration by Gulzar sahib and English is by Shabana Azmi ji.

When ferry reaches Ross Island,there will be two or three electric vehicle waiting as you enter Ross Island after taking tickets for Light & sound show.It is a scam,people sit on the electric vehicle thinking its a free service.The electric vehicle just goes to different locations in Ross Island and the driver explains what we see.Because it was dark we could not see anything properly.After less than 10 Minute driving across Ross Island the driver will drop you in front of place where Light & sound show happens and will demand Rs 80.00 per person. This is a scam which authorities must look into. The place where light & sound show happens is just 3-4 minute walk from the entrance of Ross Island,so don't fall prey to the electric vehicle scam there. 

Light and sound show at Ross Island is very good compared to light & sound show at cellular jail ,if you have spare time in evening i will highly advise you to watch this light & sound show.We were back to Junglighat jetty at 7:45 Pm after the show which last for about 40 minutes i think.You will get Autos at exit of Junglighat jetty so nothing to worry. 

Ross Island 

Ferry's to Ross Island can be got from Abeerdeen jetty or Junglighat Jetty. We took Ferry from Abeerdeen jetty.Ferry's go to two Islands,Ross Island and North bay Island and we cant go to a single Island. There are many private Ferry's from Abeerdeen jetty to go to Ross Island(also North Bay Island). Ticket costs Rs 580.00 per person for going to Ross Island and North Bay Island. It takes about 10-15 minutes from Abeerdeen jetty to reach Ross Island and you will get one hour to see Ross Island.Entrance to the Ross Island costs Rs 30.00.A brief history of Ross Island is written after entering Ross Island,do read it.Just while entering there will be a person sitting selling Kulfis @ 20 Rs.The Kulfi was good . There are electric vehicle at entrance which takes one around the Ross Island and costs Rs 80. Those having walking problem should avail this electric car as there some steep places to climb. It is a very good place to see having many dilapidated buildings and roots grown over buildings.This place has a small restaurant we only had tea there so cant comment on the restaurant.The rest rooms at Ross Island is clean and maintained properly. 

This is a good place to visit while at Port Blair. More",Feb-18

Because of its luxurious lifestyle amenities in the Island the Island was also known as ‘Paris of East’. This ‘Paris of East’ is destroyed majorly by the disastrous earthquake and Tsunami of June, 1941. The Island has also witnessed the Japanese invasion during the WWII. Because of its strategic location the Indian Navy has taken over the island in the year 1971 but kept it open for the visitors and tourists. Also this was the Island which took the brunt of the Tsunami of December, 2004 saving the Port Blair from major destruction. Due to some maintenance reasons at Rajiv Gandhi Sports Complex (i visited in Feb '18), now ferries start from Junglighat Jetty.

As soon as you step in to Ross Island you feel transported to an era gone by with the ruins of the erstwhile capital of the British empire in Andaman Islands. A walk through the ruins and the island as such can be very refreshing as well as exhilarating. 
There are many deers, rabbits to keep you company there. If possible do carry some bread or biscuits to feed these animals, which is thrilling for children. The old church at the top of the island and the Avatar like tree are really unmissable. Though there is a beach on the other side, access is prohibited after the Tsunami. The presence of Ross Island infact, prevented the Tsunami from hitting Port Blair thus saving the city from further devastation.

There’s lots to do on the island. If you come during the day, walk around to see old buildings - a church, officers club, water treatment plant, swimming pool, a cemetery and even a Japanese bunker. There’s also a battery car drive. There are many animals on the island - deer, peafowl and rabbits and children would love to play with the rabbits. Do be wary of deer with horns though. 
Once the sun sets, do stay back to watch the light and sound show.

Two swimming pools, churches, tennis courts, magistrates house, barracks and more!!! After the Britishers left and the Japanese invaded Ross and then subsequently left - the island stood as a testament to the shining era... but time and earthquakes have brought the building down and the tsunami has destroyed parts of the island. The structures that still stand are because nature has reclaimed what was hers and she holds these buildings captive in the grasp of the banyan tree roots that have now captured the structures. Had it not been for the roots - the remaining buildings too would have collapsed! 
A must visit. Requires a lot of walking. Some routes are uphill. The island houses more than 500 deers, peacocks and rabbits!!!

Homage time was from 10 am to 11 am. so the cruse did not move at that time. After waiting half an hour we moved towards Ross Island by boat. Ross Island was the former capital of Port Blair during the British regime. It had every thing at that period such as bakery, stores, bazar, workshop, water distillation plant, church, tennis court, printing press, hospital, secretariat, open air theatre etc. But today nothing is there. Every thing has disappeared. A few building structures left there which housed some of these landmarks. Now-a-days it is maintained like a museum. More",Dec-16

Nothing much but whatever is there is good. Ruins of British Administration , Free running Deers, Rabbits, Peacocks (many). You can interact with them. Good photography options with Animals. Best part is Light and Sound Show of about 30 minutes in Hindi (Javed Akhtar's voice) and in English (Shabana Azmi's voice). Show is filled with Cartoon and light effects with good sound effect. Show talks about Ross and its relation with Cellular Jail and 2nd world war. Over all much better than Cellular Jail. Ross show has better light effects, better graphics and visualizations as compared to Cellular Jail show that is more of a sound show. But both are a must watch for History seekers.

We were surprisingly greeted by gorgeous deers and peacocks. They were strolling on the Island freely and seemed more than happy to entertain visitors and even pose for them. 

You get to marvel at the beauty of mother nature and reimagine the past British colonisation. Ross Island was once headquarter capital of East India Company led British Empire on Andaman Islands. 

Huge island trees, various animals & birds in their natural habitat, ruins from the times of British colonisation. All very picturesque!

On entering the island, one is welcomed by a series of boards that mention the history of the island, followed by a visit to the different aristocratic areas,

Ross island also has a light and sound show, details of which can be inquired with the guide.

Ruined Paris of the East,Sudeshna C,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,05-Nov-16,"A visit to the Ross Island using inter island ferry service revealed a ruinous glimpse of 'the Paris of the East'. Ross was across the waters from Port Blair that housed the Cellular Jail, and was used for British residences. It had its church, clubs (separate for Senior and Subordinate Officers of the British Army), a graveyard that bore the memories of a lot of young lives lost on this tropical island owing to malaria and other water borne diseases and of course, the Japanese bunkers built during the 3 year occupation of the islands by the Japanese, during the Second World War. 

What came as a complete surprise was that the island was teeming with deer, peacocks, pea hens and rabbits- each seemed to have chalked out their undisputed territories. These roamed around the island, now protected by the Indian Navy, without batting a lid at the hordes of tourist eyes, staring them down and clicking selfies. 
Though Ross Island was now in ruins, its very location had saved Port Blair from being destroyed by the tsunami in the recent past. The roots of its very very old trees ,enmeshed with the overflowing branches, to make a ‘junglee’ lattice that housed the peacocks and other species on the island.

But we've all heard of the phrase, "" Don't judge a book by it's cover"" and so when we reached Ross, checked out the Japanese Bunker (it's ceiling was too low; maybe the Japanese people of that time were really short) and finally went further in, we were only to be awed. The island was full of deer. White spotted deer were spread all over the island. Couple of times we even saw albino rabbits darting around. And if that wasnt wildlife enough on this island, you can see flocks and flocks of Peacocks and peahens. And as the island wasn't much big, we finished sightseeing in about 30 minutes.

Great Island to explore,Ferozeuddin,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,19-Oct-16,"Ross Island was the former Capital of the Andamans and therefore there is a lot to explore. 
Normally the tour guides / boats first take you to North Bay where they give you a lot of time enticing you to indulge in paid activities there, from which they get commission. 
Then they bring you to Ross Island and the tourists are given only one hour. This is not enough to explore the Island. Not only was this Island the former Capital, but it was of great significance during the second world war, when it was under Japanese occupation. 
Hence one needs a lot of time to explore the entire Island. It is better to take a separate boat to Ross Island so that one has enough time to explore. The trips that take you both to North Bay and Ross Island, basically ignore Ross Island as they cannot get any extra income there. More",Oct-16

A lovely way to spend half a day,sripathi3,"Chennai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,03-Jul-16,We had four hours to kill before our flight and we took a trip to Ross Island. We hired our own boat for Rs.1500 so that we could be sure to return whenever we wanted to. The island was quiet with beautiful shady walkways and plenty of dilapidated buildings. Apparently Ross Island was the seat of government when the British came to Andaman Islands. From the layout we could decipher that it must have a hive of activity in those days. We hopped onto a battery car which zipped around and stopped in front of various buildings. There are neat signs which explain what each structure was used for. What was most interesting was to see huge trees growing from the roofs and the massive roots completely encircling the structure. There is lovely lotus pond with two sit-outs on either end. There are plenty of deer which seem especially fond of tender coconut pulp!! However it is frightening to see visitors handle them carelessly as the antlers can do quite some damage. I really wish the authorities would warn people from handling these animals. We saw a peacock dancing with its plumage fully exposed and it was pretty sight in the green foliage of the dilapidated Secretariat building. We resolved to return to Ross Island during our next trip and do a leisurely tour of the island on foot - definitely a fun thing to do. More,Jul-16

Peaceful Island-Recommended to visit,GauravGupta4,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,30-Jun-16,"We reached Rajiv Gandhi Water Sports Complex in Port Blair at 9:30 am from where we were supposed to go to ROSS island and NORTH BAY CORAL ISLAND. Ross Island is 15-20 min away and you need to walk on the island to explore it. British use to stay here before they came to Port Blair. It had some great old trees and some really big coconut trees. You can see a lot of deer roaming here. Island has a total of 400 deers. Don't miss to have coconut water here. You can see some of the old structures like water distillation plants, swimming pool etc., which were used by Britishers. 
In my opinion unless you are really out of time, you must visit this island as it gives a flavour of how people use to live here and has immense greenery and animals (deer, rabbit etc.). Ferry that will come here form Port Blair will give you approximately 90 minutes-2 hrs after which you need to head back to the ferry. 
Entry ticket to this island is INR 30. Ferry which takes you to Ross Island also takes you to North Bay island (assuming your tickets is for both islands) and it costs a total of INR 550. More",Jun-16

Spare two hours to the minimum,ixigo1,"Hyderabad, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,27-Jun-16,"People get off immediately to get into the buggy that will take you around the island. Once that is filled you are on your own. There was a empty buggy and on enquiry, he said he was a official but he took around another group that came later who must either be some officials family making using of the tax payer money or the official using the tax payer money to make some money for himself!!! 

The free roaming animals on the island are quite an attraction - especially for the little ones. Deers, peacocks, rabbits all roaming freely. Its a first for me. The walking takes some effort as some of the pathway is sloped. There is a small beach here on the opposite side of the entry point to the island. If only i had more time. My tour operator - Andaman excursions - arranged tickets for the unscheduled light and sound show on the island which was quite a visual and narrative treat. Be prepared for the mosquitoes once it gets dark. More",Mar-16

A must visit spot where abruptly time has stood still,zfr19389,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,20-May-16,"Across the 2 miles of sea by a large boat, from Andaman Sports Complex end at Port Blair, we enter the island, where structures stand, as the British had left, though now raptured in the Angkor Wat style. The delapidated bakery, the Church, water treatment plant, power house, printing press, the Commissioner's bungalow, etc stands as mute witness to tell us the past stories about the activities that had once happened back in history. There are the Japanese bunkers, which tell us about their occupation of the island, between 1942 to '45, when Netaji Subhas Bose had once hoisted the Indian flag there on the Government House. 

The island, surrounded by the blue sea, retains unique charm of unspoilt greenery and foliage, populated by a large herd of spotted deer and many peacocks, roaming free, so much so that you can take selfie with them, if you are carrying the camera (allowed with a fee). 

Two to three hours time would be good enough for the trip, and if lucky, one can witness the light and sound show, if the show is on. As the evening descends, an eerie silence and a haunted feeling grips you. Thus may hurry back home with a great feeling. More",May-16

Miss. Anupama, know for her excellent knowledge of this Island is the best person to be accompanied if you really wana know the History of Ross Island. I was not able to see the Light & Sound Program but will soon share the experience of the that too with you all. 

ya, forgot to say the Island is house to a huge population of Spotted Deers...one can see them from real close without any barriers or walls grazing freely, but request you to not feed..!! More",Jan-16
Lovely Island,SheetalPatankar,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,11-Mar-16,"We visited Ross Island in February, 2016. This island is done as a part of 3 island (Ross, Viper and North Bay) tour or 2 island tour (Ross and North Bay). A ferry takes you on either of these 2 tours. 
We did only Ross Island - so we took a speed boat (seating 6 people) ride to the island. By speed boat it was a mere 5 minute ride from the jetty at Rajiv Gandhi Water Sports Complex. The ferry takes a little longer as it is a bigger vessel carrying more people. If you have issues with sea sickness, speed boat is not a good option. The island has bunkers, buildings etc but are not in good condition due to bombings during World War II and also due to Tsunami of Dec 2004 (Ross island bore the brunt and saved Port Blair). 
You can walk around the island and explore the place. There are deer, peacocks and pea hens which roam freely around the island. An hour and a half is good enough to spend on this island. If you are lucky you could meet Ms. Anuradha Rao - a super lady who has spent all her life looking after the animals on this island and at no charge!! We had the opportunity to meet and interact with her and were really awed by the amount of selfless work that she is doing. More",Feb-16

A massive earthquake wreaked havoc on the Island in 1941 and all that remains today are the ruins with a fully restored Bakery that is near to the jetty. It will take a good couple of hours, even more, to walk around and get a feel of the layout but because of the change in the ferry departure place in Port Blair this is not possible. When I went last month, the ferry no longer departed from the Water Sports Park from where you can see Ross Island straight ahead. (The journey from there was about 10 minutes or so). It now departs from Junglighat jetty and the journey takes about an hour. Why it has been shifted is beyond me. All it has succeeded in doing is making the journey longer and shortening the time given to explore the Island. There are display boards just after you disembark which chart the history and life of the Island. There is also a sign saying, amongst other things, that feeding of animals is strictly prohibited. Sadly this is ignored by quite a few visitors who I witnessed, that seemed to think it ok to feed the deer and the peacocks. For those reading this review, please do not feed the animals; you may be doing more harm than good. They are not lacking any source of food...

You can be lost in history by roaming around the paths, ruins. It's very beautiful also. No wonder why British used to choose this island for their own residence. Once you enter from ferrey, hundreds of deers and some peacocks would welcome you. Only complaint is returning ferries from Port Blair doesn't normally allow more than 2 hours, which is not at all sufficient to properly visit this excellent place.

When their antlers dashed with each other,they were scared and were ready to run. this is what we cannot express in words or in pictures...So go and visit this place.

There is so much history and almost a melancholy to the place imagining what went on here ~200 years ago. The walks around the small island in that sense are quite serene. It is not a ghost town but an entire ghost island albeit a small one. The big surprise to me was the light and sound show in the evening. I had a pre conceived notion of a fairly boring and standard show but boy was I wrong ! I have seen many a show and exhibition about history is many places around the world but hands down this was the BEST light and sound performance I have ever seen. The whole show is scripted brilliantly and in the open backdrop that it is is projected it is just awe inspiring.

Live life king size,Abhijit L,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,27-Aug-15,"This picturesque island gives a glimpse of how the British rulers of India lived a life of plenty and comfort while the Freedom Fighters languished in the Cellular Jail half-fed and tortured (and finally hanged ‘’till dead”). Keeping this painful history behind, one may try to mentally reconstruct the magnificent place it was. The buildings are in ruins today with roots of huge trees spreading through the red-brick structures (in process cracking these up or holding these together?). The residential quarters, club houses, offices, warehouses, pools etc complete with a chapel are well out with roads winding through these – greeneries abound and beautiful blue sea all around. Try imagining what it was like! 

Pardon my naughty thoughts. I have a suspicion that the settlers also had resorted to the process of tendering, selection of lowest quote, under the table gratifications etc when these buildings were constructed. How else the settlement withered (with due consideration to salt-laden humid condition) within say one hundred years given the kind of engineering prowess the British claimed those days. 

Usually in a package, tourists visit this island for an hour or two, but this site definitely deserves more attention. 

Finally, I would like to record a word of appreciation and gratitude for the excellent upkeep of the site by naval defense establishment. More",Jan-15

Alternate Option.,Guha Rajan M,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,24-Jul-15,"There have been quite a lot of reviews on Ross island and hence nothing much more to add from my end. However, apart from scenic beauty of Ross island, I wish to add an alternative option as well at Aberdeen Jetty for tourist, as we visited the jetty on all the 3 days we stayed here. 

Just before the Aberdeen Jetty bridge there is a small back water bay with a over-bridge. The ocean water level increases or reduces in the small back water bay depending whether is a low tide or high tide. When its low tide with cool climate and if you lucky you can view fishes, coral reef etc. Apart from fishes, coral reefs we were lucky to spot even star fishes. 

There is a good walk way & park at Aberdeen jetty and hence you spend time gazing at scenic beauty of this place, particularly in the evenings. More",Jul-15

The Japanese Bunker that welcomes you along with the azure blue waters is just amazing. As you traverse on the island you encounter Deer, Peacock, Squirells and so may flaura and fauna.

A forlorn throwback to a majestic era,Ketan C,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,30-Jun-15,"Ross Island, with its stately ruins of a church, bakery, club etc stands as a reminder of the past glories that it wielded. It is difficult to imagine that such a tiny piece of land could have housed such a bustling population and that it lacked for nothing in terms of entertainment, all basic needs taken care of. Now uninhabited except by a few deer and lots of rabbits, there was a time when people were born, lived and died there. When i stood at the altar of the now dilapidated Presbyterian Church, my mind went back to the numerous services that must have been conducted there. When one walks into the musty remains of the bakery, one wonders of what delightful items it must have churned out, long long ago. Barring the ruins, which make one ponder and wonder how life must have been back then, is also a small little stretch of beach, quietly tucked away at the eastern tip of the island. This is an idyllic spot with some good surf. It might take one away from the overall melancholy of the island and its ruins. More",Aug-14

Having only half a day to kill we didn’t have high expectations, but what we found there was pretty stunning. Being interested in botany, it was amazing to find tropical palms and trees from all over the former British Empire. Royal Palms from the Caribbean, Mauritias from South America and a mature Morton Bay Fig from Queensland, Australia. Better than any botanical garden I have visited in Southern India. It is hard to believe that the buildings being slowly reclaimed by the rainforest have only been abandoned in the 1940s. The overgrowth was kind of reminiscent of the remoter Mayan ruins in Quintana Roo and Guatemala.

To add to that there is some tame wildlife as well, There are plenty deer and peacocks that roam around freely in the island. The batter down church is a sight to behold. Lots of informative boards are placed all over the place so you don't really feel like you need a guide for this place.

If you are tired and can't walk around the island anymore - just sit and enjoy the relaxing view of the blue sea around you. Warning - the water leading from Port Blair to Ross Island is a little choppy - so be careful if you get sea sick easily. More",Dec-14

Place is nicely maintained. It is clean and tidy. They charge about Rs.50 something for the entry. You can still see old constructions like water boilers, hospitals, temples, lakes, bakery etc. Animals like Deer, Rabbit, Peacocks are free and safe to roam in the premises. It takes about 1 to 1.5 hrs to roam around the island. 

Ferry from Rajiv Gandhi Water Sports Complex jetty drops you at Ross island. Many people recommend using private boat but cost of the ride is double than government. Government has given contracts to private firms to operate the boats. I found them OK. Distance between Ross and port blair is not much so it is manageable. You also get return ticket of ferry scheduled to return after 2 hours. 
If you have 3-4 hours of time I recommend to visit the place. Do look for information boards, they are useful. 

Hope it helped. 

Thanks. More",Nov-14

This island was struck by tsunami in year 2004 that devastated the rest of the ross island and also major areas of Thailand.. But Ross island saved the entire andamman nicobar from being devastated by taking full pressure of tsunami waves...so a less strong tsunami wave could reach the rest of the andaman which caused not that huge destruction but submerged the paddy fields and destroyed the shore line trees...

The island is big enough to be covered in the time given by the boat guys. The same boat will take us after 3hrs. If you miss the boat then we have to wait for an hour more but its better we be back within the time. 
Coming to the island, there is a minimal amount for entrance. It is full of greenery but difficult during summers as it is really humid. You will find Japanese bunker here and there all around the island. A place worth a watch. Canteens are present at the island but better to carry your own food and water. More",Sep-14

The 1941 earthquake, forced many people to leave the Island. Later the island was completely abandoned in 1945. In 1979, the island was handed over to Navy. The Navy was responsible for upkeep and maintenance of the Island. In 1993, a museum was established to display a collection of old records and photographs. A guesthouse has been put up for the Navy officers on the Island. 

The Island has a lot of deer/stags in the forest. All the deer have been named by a middle aged tourist guide. The deer respond to her whenever they are called by name. Tea, snacks and coconut water are available on payment. Walking around the Island is the only option. 

Light and Sound show is interesting and enlightening about the history of the Island. The timings for the show are from 5:30 PM to 6:30 PM. It is advised to reach by 4 PM to explore the island before the light and sound show. Tickets for the show are available at Tourist Office in Port Blair.

Subsequently he made the freedom fighters to built houses, offices, barracks and other structures at this Island. Once the construction work was over the freedom fighters were sent to Viper Island, where the first jail was built for them. He got built a bungalow called Government House. 

There was earth quake in 1941. The Japanese admiral occupied this Government House during 1942 to 1945. Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose sought the help of Japanese in his fight against the British. He stayed at the Island for a day in December 1943. Every Indian must be proud of this great patriot and Hero of freedom struggle. It was he who hoisted the Indian Tri colour at the top of the Government House in Ross Island. But after the Second World War the Island was re-occupied by the British even though they never went back to the Island. 

It is in the Indian history that Ross Island was handed over to the Indian Navy in April 1979, which has set up a small post, INS Jarawa, named after one of the indigenous tribes of the Andaman group of islands. 
A museum was opened in December 1993. 

You can avail the boat services from Port Blair to Ross Island on paying entry fee but for children up to nine years no such entry fee. You can’t take photo from the front part of the island as it is a secured place. Don’t ignore to take tickets for all kind of cameras at the entry point itself to avoid embarrassment of being caught. 
The guide will certainly take you to the Picture gallery where you can see photos of Ross Island 

You will love the bakery items in Ross Island. 
The natural scenic beauty and landscape are marvellous. I experienced soothing effect here. Better wear sunscreen and sunglasses, a cap and carry an umbrella while walking as a safety measure. 

You will wonder to see Japanese bunkers and a lot of tunnels, deers and peacocks in the forest over here.

North bay is only for snorkeling, water scooter and glass bottom boat so if you have already enjoyed those in Neil/Havelock/Jolly Buoy/Red Skin you can easily skip visiting that island. Viper island is a completely historic spot. Ross island is a combination of natural beauty and strong history. There are many old buildings which were constructed by British but later destroyed by Japanese Bombing. There is a small museum on the island which describes ancient history and displays souvenir. There are 2 3 food stalls as well so you don't have to carry food at all. 

Upon arriving the Ross island jetty, you have to pay an entry fee and extra charge is there for camera(a very small amount though). You can stay as much time as you want. There are roads in multiple direction and if no tourist guide is there with you, you can roam on your own. Deer in Ross are very much friendly and they will come very close to you but do remember feeding them is a strict offense. We have spotted many deer near the jetty and they are friendly in nature. Another beauty of the island is peacock and there are plenty. You won't find them near the jetty. In order to have a glimpse of them, you have to move a little deeper into the forest. We were warned that snake is also there but we didn't care. 

There are three beaches in Ross island. By three beaches I mean, three openings are there to face the sea and each has seats with shade so you can enjoy at any one among those three. Overall it's a very fantastic island but don't got there with very little time in hand. You won't find it appealing if you stay for a very short time. More",Mar-14

Ruins of the Capital...,muditk2014,"Dibrugarh, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,23-Jun-14,"A short ferry ride from Port Blair brings you to this abandoned island which was once the Headquarters of Andamans. The place was rocked by a massive earthquake in 1941 and was hence abandoned. The place is now kept alive by the very helpful Indian Navy. 

From a traveler's point of view, the place is a explorers paradise. On he jetty you are greeted by a handful of free indian spotted deers making you think when was the last time you saw the species roaming so freely. Few things not to miss- Japanese Bunkers, ruined Church, English Barack, Helipad & the Huge Tankers. The place is easy to walk and spread over 400sq mtrs. The beauty of the island are the huge trees which have exposed roots crawling over these ruined buildings and binding them together. It looks as if mother nature couldn't loose more and held everything together! 

Traveler Tips: 
Carry something to snack on. Drinking water, tea/coffee, bottled beverages are available at the navy souvenir shop inside. The place is exposed to the sky so carry your umbrella, sunglasses & sunscreen as the weather here is unpredictable. Take the three island ticket from Aberdeen Jetty to reach here. Its available instantly and on the spot.

Yes of course if you don't fascinate places with historical backgrounds, you can always visit it as just another spot with remnants of the past. Apart from the ruins, what can attract you is a number of Deer casually walking here and there around you, and if you can trick them with a biscuit or chips in your hand, they will come to you and eat it (perfect chance to click them as well). There are a few peacocks as well playing hide and seek with you, if you could find them don't miss to click. It just takes a 30 minute boat ride from Marina Park, there are boats service at regular intervals, but I would say as you visit Ross, you must give time to explore it.

The ruins at the Island are not interfered with much, and nature had its course with them, This makes very interesting sights at the Island with the trees and building mingling into one entity. 

The views on the Island are great and it is recommended to spend some time here. There is a very beautiful beach on the back side of the Island, and should not be missed. Around 100 or so steps takes you down to the beach, but the natural beauty makes up for it.

One has to take a boat from Aberdeen Jetty close to Rajiv Gandhi Water Sports complex. 
The boat costs Rs. 100 (One Way or that is what was told to us) and further Rs. 20/- to enter the island. 
I would hope the whole process of purchasing tickets and boarding boats can be a bit better organised. 
We took a 9:30 am boat and had to comeback via 11:30 am, but by the time we reached jetty on Ross Island at 11:30 the boat had already left. 
I wouldn't recommend the 3 island tour to start at 9:30 as it only gives 45 minutes in the Ross Island before the boat starts for next island. 
One needs to have around 2 hours to have a good relaxed stroll around the island.

The structures are now almost entirely covered with creepers and roots of peepal trees, but one can still get a feel of how the place would have looked like in the heydays of the British Raj. The place is being maintained well with well-laid paths that connect to the main attractions. Large signboards provide details about the place to travelers (a rarity in most Indian historical tourist spots) It would have been nicer if some of the main buildings like the chief commissioner's bungalow (where Netaji, apparently stayed during visit to the island in 1943) were cleared of the vines a bit and some attempt made to restore them to something close to their former glory. The island also has a beautiful beach. Do not miss the statue of the lone sailor and the lighthouse on one corner of the island - particularly if you are a keen photograph. There are restrooms available. There is one canteen that serves veg and non-veg fare (tastes good if you are hungry :) ) Since you have to cover the island on foot, try to visit in the morning.

The church is an amazing structure and the coast line is beautiful and worth the trek to 'the other side'. Do go and explore this wonderful place, you won't regret it.

It's a tiny island that one can walk across and all around in roughly an hour.This erstwhile headquarters of the British is in ruins but the fascinating history of that period is still very palpable if one looks around carefully;guides provide a lot of info too,and a small museum at the jetty contains some artefacts from that era. 

The meticulous organisation of the colonisers is very much in evidence here-a desalination plant,printing press,bakery,officers mess,Administrator's bungalow,church,etc. are all laid out carefully,and though overgrown with moss,creepers and even humungous trees,still tell a story of their own. 

The greenery is astounding,and a few deer roam freely;one can amble down the top of the hillock on which the church sits to the pebbly beach for a quick dip.It's a day trip and overnight stay is not allowed.Along with the North Bay Island and others nearby,though greatly devastated by the 2004 tsunami,it still offers an unforgettable experience!

A beautiful Island of historical importance,pathakan,"Duliajan, Dibrugarh (Assam)",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,11-Oct-13,"A beautiful island just off Port Blair with a lot of historical ruins of british time. Peacocks and deers roam around freely and mix with the tourists. Greenery in abundance and part of history well preserved. As told to us in 2004 Tsunami waves first dashed against this island and a lot of destruction was there; but the silverlining - this saved Port Blair from bigger destuction and losses as it was protected by Ross Island. 
History - This island was first occupied by British in 1858 who brought freedom fighters from India, who cleared the jungles, made houses and offices for the British and then they were moved to Viper island where the first jails were built. Subsequently markets, clubs for officers, tennis courts, swimming pools etc were constructed to serve a population of around 500 people who were stationed here. The remains of these can still be seen here. In 1942 it went into Japanese occupation who were here upto the end of second world war (1945). More",Sep-13

The place is monitored and you may get rebuked by the locals if caught red handed!

The place is well maintained with RUINS, I wonder how ruins are well maintained?!!! Anyways, it's worth visiting. 
Some important areas are the Presbyterian Church, Commissioner Bungalow, The Ballroom, Hospital, Press, Generator room etc.. 

The island also is guarded by a Japanese Bunker, built, obviously, by the Japanese during their invasion from 1942-45. 

The place is full of Deers roaming around who are very friendly to human beings. But it's request that please do not feed them with things that they cannot digest, and you don't know what are those things. Hence better not to feed them. 
If you're dying to feed one, buy a Tender coconut, drink the water and peel the inside and give it to them. They tolerate it well.

The entire island is in ruins. There are thick roots of trees growing all around the dilapidated structure. It is beautiful in an unconventional and unorthodox way. I can’t find words to express the beauty, have some pics hope they can express what I am unable to. It did remind me of Angkor Wat I had seen in documentaries. 
If you spend time here you can almost see the families of the Brit here in all their glory. The Church, the swimming pool here can transport you to glorious past almost like a time machine. Also the Japanese bunkers here tell altogether a different story. 
Do try to go in early as walking in the sun can be tiring. Also do end the trip with tender coconut freshly cut off the trees on the island.

Definitely a highlight of the trip to Port Blair. There are also places to sit and have a leisurely cold drink or a snack. Ferries are fairly frequent and it has not been overpriced for foreigners.

The highlight though is the gutted shell of the old Church where nature has stamped it's ownership in the form of an enormous tree which has conquered the Brit's pile of rubble. More poignantly a visit to the cemetery reveals stories of men who lost their lives at sea. The Japanese Army's brief invasion also left it's mark in the shape of some machine gun nests that you can ferret around. I also enjoyed spying a Peacock strutting it's stuff to a local Peahen and the deer are ridiculously tame (please treat them with care). On Ross Island is you have great freedom to explore, there's minimal signage and no attempts to mediate your experience by tarting the place up unnecessarily or providing guides.

Must visit to see the ruins,Amritha03,"Hyderabad, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,03-Mar-13,"Ross island has some very beautiful old buildings. These buildings were built and used by the Britishers. If you take stroll around, you would come across a number of deers and peacocks. The deers have been introduced to humans and aren't scared of us. Some even allow us to caress them. The last boat from the island to Port Blair is at 4:30 p.m. At around 3:00-3:30, the workers at the island feed the deers. This is a beautiful sight. You can see all the deers approaching the food as the workers let out a cry for them. At this time, few of the peacocks join them for the food. 
Its best if you are able to walk the entire island. Should take about an hour to do so.

Ross Island mainly has ruins of British buildings. But these ruins are creepy with enormous tress grown over them. Do visit the musuem on Ross Island. 
There are ruins of old church, temple, bazaar, officers quareters, etc. We were given only 45 mins to see the entire island and it surely wasnt enough.

"Ross Island , a very rosy island :)",DAVIDMURALI,MUMBAI,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,27-Feb-13,"This is an Island in the Andaman & Nicobar group of Islands and is a must visit on a trip to Port Blair. The small island with its treasure of ruins has become a hot spot for tourists spot. It takes around 4 to 5 hours to go around this island which has dilapidated structures of the bakery, water purification plant, a Protestant Church, printing press and many others which the British build. This Island was basically occupied as an Administrative headquarters for the islands before it was shifted to Port Blair. The innumerable coconut trees, deers and the ruins alongwith water fronts on all sides is highly romantic place and one will fall in love with this place.

Other things to see at this place is one small museum having pictures of British period and a 500 Yrs. old tree, as told by the guide. You can watch a light house from the entry of this ,Island, which is printed on Rs.20 Indian currency . 
Tips:- You should come in your walking shoes if possible, This is an deserted island with few residences for Army personnel ,so don’t expect any restaurant dine or wine places here .Bring your own eatables with you, although there is one small Cafeteria ,serving tea ,coffee and few eatable ,but that too in limited quantity. 
To end with, I can say that visit to this Island of remnants of British period ny will have lingering effect in my mind .It is one of the must see place for the visitors to Adman.

"good Island , Interesting ruins ....",Sushil P,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,30-Oct-12,"The mistake people do ( and also done by me ..!!!!! ) is that they go for three island tour ( Ross/Viper/North bay ) package run by the Andaman tourist association for 1 day . The tour will cost 500 rs per head and they will give lunch also . 
Problem is the tour starts at 9.30 am and the first island visited is Ross Island ( 10 mins by the ferry ). They give only 45mins to see the island and it is not at all sufficient to cover the whole island . so i will recommend to plan at least 1/2 day tour only to Ross Island . Please avoid the three Island tour . 
The Island was once Capital , and was well planned but today you can only see very interesting ruins . It will be good to hire a guide to understand the importance of the place . 
Also one fact we came to know that Ross Island blocked the high waves during the tsunami to reach sports complex and thus avoided some damage . More",Oct-12

We also took a Guide(Mrs. Rao) who is born and brought up there and loved the place and the animals. She explained us in details about how the British Officers lived there, the distilled water tank they used for bathing and drinking, and about the Tsunami attack and a lot of other stuff. She was carrying loaves of bread and was continuously feeding the deer and the small birds. The whole time all of them were following us and it was an wonderful experience to feed them ourselves.

Find a package that takes you to Ross Island and North Bay. 

If that is not available then it makes no sense to go to Viper Island where you have nothing to see. I fail to understand what is the tourist attraction on that place.

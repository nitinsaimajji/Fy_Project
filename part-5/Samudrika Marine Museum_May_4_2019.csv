A short introduction to the tribes (it's better to go to the anthropological museum for that), a movie with nice images, a coral and shell collection badly presented (no explanation, high shelf, ...). It's sad because the ocean around the Andaman islands is the major point of interest, but the museum does not present it.

This is called a torsional embryonic error and the mutation is not fully understood . These snails have great difficulty in breeding as their genitalia do not line up properly to normal snails . Since they cannot pass on the trait by breeding , such snails are probably the result of freak mutation and are likely to remain extremely rare oddities . Please look at the exhibit in this light .

They have well maintained the place, there is brief history of Islands with paintings, pictures, shells, corals, models etc. They have decent collection of shells and corals found around Islands. Place is neat and clean with a proper sitting area before you enters the rooms containing different objects etc. 
Photography is not allowed in some parts of museum, else you can take pictures. The small garden in front of main building is maintained. 
Though there are not too many things and museum itself is a small place in comparison to different museums all around the world but it is worth visiting this place to get a brief introduction to the island and its flora and fona. 
Don't go with high expectations and enjoys the things on the display. More",Feb-12

Marine History & Life,Bishal K S,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,31-May-12,"Liked the different rooms that clearly categorize what you are looking at. The information is usful, though how much you'll carry back home is questionable. Children will like the fishes and you'll be amazed by the size and shapes of the corals and shells. Didn't like the fact that they charge you extra for a camera, as there is no security inside and people who haven't paid are still clicking away. Has a small souvenior shop where you could get some interesting knick knacks for people back home.",May-12

IT IS ALSO KNOWN AS NAVAL MARINE MUSEUM!!!!!!,rishi700,"Haldia, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,27-Apr-12,"Samudrika is under the administration of the navy. The Samudrika is therefore also referred to as the Naval Marine Museum.The Samudrika is particularly famous for an exquisite collection of shells, corals and other significant specimens of the marine life typical of these islands. Other than shells and corals, one can also find a good collection of fishes of different colors.One can visit the Samudrika from 8.30 am to 12 noon and again from 2 pm to 5 pm. The museum remains closed on all national holidays as well as Mondays.The Samudrika is located on the opposite side of Andaman Teal House in Delanipur.The Samudrika Marine Museum has five sections(rooms)-background of Andaman Islands, Geographical information, people of Andaman, Archeology and lastly the Marine lifestyle.

time pass,Sukhen Kumar s,kishanganj,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,30-Mar-12,giving it a miss if you has something else to do.there was hardly anything worthwhile to see.,Nov-11
It is OK,Amitabha B,"Kanpur, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,15-Mar-12,Considering the state of the A&N administered fisheries museum this is a really well done museum. If you consider some of the marine museums abroad this pales in comparison but some of the exhibits are worth the time you will spend here. Please do not buy camera tickets. I paid for three cameras but did not find anything worth photographing.,Mar-12

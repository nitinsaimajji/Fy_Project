"Efficient, on-time, easy",Neelie C,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,06-May-19,"Even though it's at a premium fare, taking a Makruzz ferry between the gorgeous islands of Andamans is totally worth it. It's the quickest option and very relaxed. From checking in to claiming baggage, it's all very simple. We also got a chance to meet Capt. Bobby and First Officer Karan on our trip. They are great gentlemen and I felt pretty safe knowing our journey was in their hands. Well done, Makruzz. Great team and great experience!",Apr-19
Best in Business,Soppa_0312,"Pune, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,05-May-19,"The Makruzz ferry services are probably best in the business when it comes to inter-island commuting. The staff is highly professional which makes the ride much more better. The in-house café is also great with some nice variety of food. However, there is no proper deck and therefore no one is allowed on the deck which is like a turnoff. 

We boarded MAK 2 for travelling to Neil island and then to Port Blair from Neil. MAK 2 has tainted glass or rather black windows which doesn't allow the view of the sea. The sea ride to Neil and Port Blair from Neil is very, very choppy and a lot of travelers experienced nausea and sea sickness. 
All in all a good experience. More",Apr-19
Luxury sailing,jewelynroy,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,05-May-19,We as a family of 6 visited Andaman last month all excited to know what the beautiful island had in store for us. Cruising away to the gorgeous Neil in Makruzz Gold was on of the highlights of the trip. The ship offers smooth travel with luxury at very affordable prices. The staff are extremely helpful and polite and are very courteous in managing some super excited travellers . The icing on the cake for us was being able to cruise with the captain himself Mr. Bobby Giles and Chief officer Karan Narang. Super helpful with giving us the right information we needed to go about with our adventures at Neil to letting us witness the trill of sailing along with them. Strongly recommend that you use Mak for ur cruising while in Andaman. Go witness it urself. Its breathtaking. Cheers! More,Apr-19

Great service from port Blair to havelock,ShakeOnVacay,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,29-Apr-19,"We took the makruzz from port Blair to havelock and back. 

We were on the upper deck (delux) class, but there wasn’t much difference. The entire ship is air conditioned and very comfortable. The seats are clean and well maintained. Every journey was on time. You can purchase snacks and beverages on board as well. 

We needed to change the time on our trip back to port Blair, had to get it the tickets changed at the havelock jetty but it was a quick and easy process. 

Great way to get around the islands.",Apr-19
Excellent Service,AP1729,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,28-Apr-19,"Traveled from Port Blair to Havelock at back. The ferries were around 1450Rs per person per journey. [1450 Rs for PB -> Havelock and 1450Rs back]. The jetty for Makruzz at Port Blair is Hadoo Jetty, near Chatham [NOT Phenoix Bay (only for govt)]. Reach Hadoo Jetty atleast one hour prior. It is like an airport with security , check-in (where they assign seat nos) and then boarding. Surprisingly on the return journey there was none of this and direct boarding was present. 

The boats were quite nice and punctual. Would recommend bringing your own food- as the food they sell on the boat is more expensive. Only main complaint was couldn't see outside very well - as the windows were very dirty. More",Apr-19
Facility could be better !,AmitabhChakraborty,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,26-Apr-19,"I went to Havelock Island from Port Blair by availing Makruzz boat service. The windows were covered hence no view for about 1.5 hours ride. Loud music playing on the TV was the only mode of entertainment. Food on board, I found a bit costly.",Apr-19
Clean and quick ferry,Vanepar,"San Jose, Costa Rica",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,25-Apr-19,"The quickest way to travel within the Andaman Islands. It was punctual and staff was friendly. 
Our ferry from Port Blair to Havelock island was very fast and stable. 

Safety precautions could be taken more seriously. The emergency exit on the stern was blocked with all the luggage. If there had been an emergency, this would have been very bad. 

You have to show up 1 hour before the departure time. You have to go through security and then make a line to “check in”. Make sure you have your printed ticket. Once you check in you must wait in a hot waiting room with the whole ferry load until it’s time to board. 

The seats were comfortable but did not recline. The windows have a film so you cannot see out. It’s a bit claustrophobic. You have no sense of direction and you miss out on the outside scenery. There are onboard TV’s looping Indian music videos at full blast. 

Our return ferry did have windows so we could enjoy the island scenery. 

Travel tip: print your tickets beforehand. Small Hand luggage can be taken with you. No need to check it in with luggage. If you check in early you get better choice of seats. The bad side is you need to spend more time waiting in hot waiting rooms. If you are claustrophobic this is not the ferry for you. More",Apr-19
Its Really a Cruise...Awesome...Equal to Flight cockpit,Balaji-Bhava,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,25-Apr-19,"It was a great experience. The cost which they are charging for the cruise is very moderate and it is worth payable. Ambience, staffs and all are great!!!",Apr-19

Beautiful and comfortable experience,VINEETS19,Chandigarh,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,12-Apr-19,"We travelled from Havelock to Neil Island on a Makruzz Gold. It's quite a new, clean and beautiful ship. Some pointers: 
1) I didn't find any difference in economy or luxury seats. Only that one is one a higher deck but once you are in - the deck or floors in Makruzz doesn't matter. All seats are same and there is no view as all glass windows are convered with thick dark blue tinted sheet. 
2) Seats are better than a domestic flight in India. 
3) Small canteen is available on board. 
4) AC is really good and strong. 
5) Very punctual.",Apr-19

Only if they the dark window glasses, passengers can enjoy the ride. Further the biggest disaapointment was the baggage handling. Although the screening happens like at airport, you are not sure that your baggage is safe. No baggage tags are issued to confirm. Neither you are allowed to wait and watch your baggage being boarded. All guests are asked to leave their baggage near one end of the cruise and asked to board at the other end. Further we were shocked to find our baggage kept in the open on board while cruising. So if it rains or with big waves your baggage is definitely going to get wet. They also do not secure your bags on board risking of the same getting dropped in the sea. Further at none of the jetties they have shade to offload the baggage if it rains. While reaching port blair from neil island it was raining heavily. The only shade provided was a common plastic sheet around 20*15 feet with some holes which was to be caught by the passengers themselves for creating a covered shade for paasengers and baggage.

Nothing like a ferry !,Vaishnavee,Bangalore,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,11-Mar-19,"I was compelled to write this review because Makruzz is nothing like a ferry ! It is more like a luxury jet which takes you island hopping ! I booked my ticket online on their website itself! We need to carry a print out of all the ticket because most of the times the phone network is awful ! 
We took the ferry thrice and it was always on time! The seats are super comfortable and staff is more than willing to help you ! 
Mr. Karan onboard was kind enough to give us all pro tips about diving and fishing! It is interesting to know how they operate and carry more than 1000 people everyday from one island to another ! Nimmi was assisting us with snacks and seating was ever smiling ! If you are looking to book a ferry in Andamans it has to be Makruzz! Live the island life completely! More",Mar-19

Not worth the money,162AG,"Hyderabad, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,10-Mar-19,"We chose Makruzz for 3 trips PB-HL-NL-PB this Feb. Based on other reviews here, it was the better option though pricier. Our expectation thus was for a smooth ride. This wasn't the case. Check-in is mismanaged. You are not intimated in time and the staff randomly starts asking everyone to board making you stand in long lines which really can be avoided since everyone has a seat assigned. On board, the windows are not clean and you can't see outside - this further worsens any sea sickness. On the HL-NL route, the boat raced to the destination causing most people to throw up but did not manage to secure a berth for the next hour. The boarding process at Neil is pathetic. You have to wait on an exposed jetty for close to an hour. Really bad if you have kids or older people. Make sure to carry your hats and umbrellas. After alighting each time there's a mad rush for bags. Again something you expect this company to have figured a better way to manage. Most rides are not on time so that further reduces the time you have on each island. You have no options but to take one of these ferries here, but with Makruzz you feel cheated because you pay a ton of money and get abysmal service in return. More",Feb-19

Efficient but with loopholes,oli_mukherjee,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,04-Mar-19,"We took the Makruzz ferry from Port Blair to Havelock and back . The departure terminal in Port Blair was a nightmare. The loooong queue,the delays in baggage screening, the long wait for registration and the scramble for boarding can surely be streamlined. The full capacity of passengers didn’t really help, neither did our booking the Royal class. The vessel from Port Blair had a luxurious but claustrophobic Royal class. Very clean, with snacks and drinks. One of the major downsides was the totally blue tinted glasses which obscured the view of the brilliant blue sea that we were sailing through. So the Ferry experience was lost. Baggage retrieval is another thing they need to look into. Total chaos . The return Makruzz vessel from Havelock to Port Blair was much better. Spacious Royal Class, clear windows for the view, great staff, less passengers so better baggage handling.

Good service,ptktul,"Muzaffarpur, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,10-Feb-19,The Makruz has become the familiar name to travel to and fro from Portblair and Havelock. Service is very similar to an air travel. You need to complete all the formalities like travelling through air. Just the missing point is there is no system of maintaining your luggage digitally. You just give your luggage and it is kept in the back side of the makruzz. On arrival those are simply displayed and you can collect them. No tags no names nothing.

It was quick and departed and left on time. It was also clean inside and had decent facilities. I had arranged to stay a night in Port Blair because I didn't know if our flight would allow us time to get to the ferry port - this wasn't necessary. The cheapest tickets are good enough. It's an enclosed ferry so you don't get a great view out the windows but there's aircon. The government ferry is a fraction of the price and it's open but it's for local people and tourists have to queue for tickets from 8am the day before. More,Jan-19
Mixed experience-Makruzz,Ambarish31,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,01-Feb-19,"We were excited about the cruise journeys as we had booked Makruzz in 3 sectors Port Blair-Neil; Neil-Havelock and Havelock-Port Blair. In looks, Makruzz definitely looks decent and the seats in all the classes have nice layout. I was in dilemma for long whether to take Makruzz or Green Ocean, but opted makruzz only because they take much less time to ferry and I didnt want to spend much time in sea with my small kid. The catamaran is fast and little bit bumpy. Though scientifically it may seem that the lower part of the cruise (premier seats) is more stable, however my experience tells that in deluxe class (upper portion) we didnt feel uncomfortable, while the during our journey in one sector in premier seats, we felt like vomiting. This led me to convert tickets of the last sector Havelock-Portblair from premier to deluxe class. Overall Makruzz is luxury cruise with mixed experience, if you want to spend less time in sea this is the one, if you want to enjoy the cool sea breeze on deck, opt for something else. More",Jan-19

Nothing great. Miss the sea view,sangishan,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,30-Jan-19,"Markuzz is a catamaran and obviously one will be excited about it.The Journey is not at all exciting ,nor very comfortable. 

The catamaran has Dark coloured windows and that gives a very diluted/different view of the sea.If you are in the middle row you can hardly see any thing and the journey will fell like you are inside an aircraft. 

Since the Catamaran travels very fast the turbulence is also that much grater.Within fifteen minutes of the journey you fill find many passengers are puking.The nausea feeling is so common that within fifteen minutes the staff starts distributing Vomiting Bags. 

When I travelled in winter the sea was not very rough ,yet I found several people getting nausea and puking. 

Moreover there is no open deck .The sea breeze cannot be felt .One is confined to a cabin.I do not like the aircraft type experience on the sea. 
The pricing is exorbitantly high . 
One should only travel by Markuzz is you are short of time.Otherwise explore other options. 
Please take an anti vomiting pill like Ziofer 4 before travelling.Even if the sea is clam. More",Jan-19

"Unfortunate, but cancellations are almost impossible. Did not get my refund back",mukesh n,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,21-Jan-19,"Hi Team, 

It was unfortunate that on 6th Jan, due to the cyclone, no ferries were running and Makruuz also got canceled. We had to come back on govt ships to Portblair. 

After repeated requests for the cancellations in the last 15 days, I got the response that I will not get the refund back. 

I had a discussion with govt. officials that day and they asked us to file a refund as the makruuz ferry did not run that day and Makruuz did not incur any cost. 

Now, I did not expect the same from the so-called best ferry (based on trip advisor reviews) and its professionalism that they will try to eat people's money. I am sorry to say but I was disheartened by the response I got from Makruuz. 

And as I heard from people that this thing has happened with them before as well, this will be too risky to book a ferry with so much high rate, we bought the ticket for the convenience we will have on Makruuz but if there is a risk involved in getting those facilities, then who will book the tickets.

The boat leaves Havelock at 4 in the afternoon and soon after departure all the lights are switched off making it a dark ( why do they have deep dark windows ?) pod with nothing to do but watch mindless Bollywood songs on a TV screen.

We booked ferries with Makruzz for our trip to the Andaman Islands. Due to the monsoon, we had to cancel our trip to the islands, and I cancelled the ferry with around two weeks' notice. As per Makruzz's terms, a refund is offered (minus 100 rupees cost) provided you give 48 hours notuce. I was in touch with Makruzz and they confirmed they would refund me - so far, great service. 

Since then, I've chased them for 5 months. They constantly assure me the refund is coming (it's 6,331 rupees) but they have never paid out. They've now stopped answering my emails.

Terrible journey,rylan02,Mumbai,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,19-Nov-18,"When the seas are rough, you don't wanna be in a boat bouncing in the water at 100/mph. But Maktuzz will ensure that you bounce in the boat and reach your destination in a hurry even though everyone on the cruise is puking, I've traveled on both big boats and small boats at multiple places, and this is by far the worst experience that I've had. 

I don't even know why there is a cafeteria on this boat. While the seas are choppy, the boat is bouncing away to glory on the Andaman sea, and everyone around is puking, its strange to see a cafeteria on the boat cause no one will ever patronize it. More",Nov-18

Once we travelled Royal and the next Deluxe. The ship is the first privately owned luxury Catamaran plying in the Andamans. The ship cruises at a comfortable speed and did the trips in an hour each. In the Royal Class, we were served with a snack box, which was barely edible. But the sandwich which was served in the Deluxe class was good. The service is extremely punctual and one can bank on the vessel anytime. Just two issues which need to be improved. One the handling of the luggage of passengers - pathetic. Second the staff - poker faced, no smile and absolutely unwelcoming. The company needs to change this in order to enhance its image. I would readily choose this service over all the others, but for these two issues. More",Nov-18

Best Options For Inter Island Travel,som71cal,India,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,11-Nov-18,"Makruz Ferry is a high speed luxury boat plying between Port Blair-Havelock-Neil Island. It is perhaps the best and most luxurious way of travel between these Islands, apart from Helicopter service. There are three of them. All fully air-conditioned with facility for onboard snack counter. Though there are three different class of travel offered in each ferry, but there's very less difference between these classes except in pricing and in Satisfying you ego ;-) . Premium class is the best ""Value For Money"". If the sea is rough, then rolling felt is almost similar in all three classes. The journey time is least in Markuz in comparison to Government Ferry or another privately run ferry named Green Ocean and Bhagya Express, though the fare is also more from others. Another big advantage for Tourists is that one can book Markuz Ferry on line through their website 90 days prior; whereas the booking of Government Ferry or Bhagya Express is on site only and starts 04 days prior to journey day :-( . Four clean washrooms available in each ferry with enough janitors for their maintenance during journey.

The only problem is you can't enjoy the sea from this ferry as you are not allowed to go outside and if someone sitting near to you starts vomiting due to sea sickness that smell becomes unbearable making you too feel sick.

The cruise is seating area is closed and air conditioned so it feels like travelling by flight and we didn't observe rough ride. 
May be they can offer some open area for everyone to experience the cruise. 

They also played useful/informative video of 'Jewel of the sea' on Andaman and Nicobar islands, which gives good information about what to expect in Andaman. 

We tried for number of days (1 month before our trip) to book our trip back from havelock to Port blair but there were no seats available.

For all this we are charged 3 times the normal fare which I don't find feasible to recommend now.it is just a one and a half hour Cruise from Port Blair to Havelock where in you can take the premium class seats also which are comfortable enough at low price. The staff was friendly and they had a good on time performance. More,Oct-18

"Best amongst all, minor issues should be avoided",Shreyas_Karkhanis,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,07-Oct-18,"We travelled from Port Blair to Havelock, Havelock to Neil and Neil to Port Blair (all 3) with Makruzz. Other options are Green ocean and government ferry. However, Makruzz is more comfortable and takes lesser time than its companions. Ride is smooth and relaxing. Cooling is nice. Staff is nice and very cooperative. Sometimes, sea is rough and ride becomes bumpy. Even in this case, Makruzz is better than others. 
I feel they should improve on 2 points below:- 
1. Many times Makruzz changes its vessel and we have to take new seat numbers while checking in. New seats are based on availability at the point of time when one reaches and we may not get seats of our choice always. This vessel change should be avoided. 

2. During checkout, Makruzz keeps luggage in open itself. It becomes a problem if bag is not water resistant. They can easily keep it beneath a plastic or below shade. 
Except above two, Makruzz is the best for ride. More",Sep-18

We were lucky enough to travel on ""World Tourism Day "" and they had additional entertainment with an orchestra, songs, music and dance. It was awesome fun and the 90 mins journey passed in a jiffy. They are punctual which is a very good thing. You can submit your luggage at time of boarding and take it as you de-board. The only thing they can improve is the seating at the check-in counter in Port blair as many of the seats were broken and reduce the chaos at boarding and form straight lines. More",Sep-18

After raising voice against them they threatened me to throw out of the ship which was very unprofessional.

Royal Class,yukoyh,"Cirencester, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,26-Aug-18,"Upon arrival at the Port Blair port, you will have to go through a couple of securities before registering yourselves for check-in. We got there 7:05am for 8am ferry, but had to queue up for about 20 min to be checked-in. We took Royal class on both of our journeys. The total 8 people are seated in the Royal class compartment and we shared with a group of 6 on the way to Havelock. They are a family and chatted amongst themselves quite loudly all the way and their children were not sit still. For this reason, we sadly felt quite awkward sitting in the Royal class compartment with them. The ferry journey to Havelock was relatively calm and we did not face any sea sick. On the way back, we shared the Royal class compartment with just one local businessman. We had some small chat at the beginning and everyone fell asleep in the quiet and comfortable compartment. On the way back is against current, so Sea is more rough. I have managed not to get sea sick, by taking some travel motion sickness pills, but witnessed some passengers were sick upon arrival at Port Blair. At least 6 people opened our compartment door during journey, just to see what Royal class compartment is like, so every time door is opened, we were unfortunately disturbed. Otherwise, the ferry facility is of western standard and kept very clean. More",Aug-18

Our onward journey to Havelock was quite smooth but on our way back to Port Blair, the ride was quite bumpy may be due to rough sea or we were travelling against the tides.

Check-in, onboard and alighting experiences are good. Staff is well trained and professional. Makruzz has three classes out of which we availed two for our to and fro journeys. I would strongly recommend front row premium class seats since you will have unhindered view of the sea extending to the horizon. As you start gliding over the seas you get to experience thrill like never before. 

One way ride, depending on the time of the year, will be extremely rough and one should consult a doctor for sea sickness medication prior to the trip. 

Only downside to our trip was a mess in their reservation system which made them downgrade from our confirmed deluxe reservation to premium class. Although we were assured of refund of the differential amount but once onboard we were soon shifted to deluxe category although not to our original seats.

They are the oldest tour operator in that region but you can see that they are staying with the times and providing a great service. We took the govt ferry once and while that was not a bad experience, its not comparable to what Makruzz provides.",Jun-18
Very comfortable and memorable,malhotrav2,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,24-Jun-18,"Makruzz gold offers you a well managed, clean and punctual journey. The vessel is well built and equally pleasant interiors elevate your mood for the journey. The on-board refreshments are a bonus. Washrooms are clean and fresh.

They don't let you go out in the deck. You have to stay indoor throughout the trip.

One of the most premium experiences,sa_amaraneni,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,13-Jun-18,"We were a family of 8 with adults and teens. We took this cruise from Port Blair to Havelock and I must admit that we were completely mesmerized with the whole experience we had with Makruzz. 

Our cruise was preponed and it was very well communicated. The check in process was smooth and the departure and arrival were exact bang on time. 

Ambience inside the cruise is spellbound and you would get that instant premium feeling as soon as you enter the Makruzz. 

There is a small cafeteria inside the cruise which sells basic beverages and eateries like tea, coffee, samosa, puffs and chips. 

Our journey was pleasant and loaded with comfort and is totally worth every penny spent. 

Would surely recommend Makruzz if it fits your budget and timings - it's truly worth an experience. More",Jun-18

Best Private Ferry operator in Portblair,Sampath99,"Hyderabad, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,01-Jun-18,This is the best private ferry operator plying between portblair and havelock. Not giving 5 stars for 1 prime reason - Boat's cruise speed is high and you are sure to end up with puking. Almost 60% of the folks in the ferry ended up doing this. We were informed that this may not happen in Govt owned boats as they are really huge and cruise at lower speed as compared to Makruzz. Customer service is immaculate so is the maintenance within the boat. I would still suggest not to take this boat for your onward journey from PB to HL as it may end up spoiling your journey.,May-18
Luxury at Sea,sanjeevtk02,"Patna, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,30-May-18,"Beautiful cruise, smooth online booking and check in. Easily approachable jetty, vehicles drop you about 100m near it.

comfortable but should have open decks,Sonalkumar220,"Noida, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,29-May-18,"We traveled first time on a big boat or a mini ship whatever you can say it. It's a catamaran style cruise boat and is very luxurious and fast. 

We loved the interiors and and the seats were super comfortable with good leg space. the only bad thing that you can say is that you are not allowed to go on the deck and the glass panels are also very very dark . once you are in the boat you almost can't enjoy the view outside. that was a very downside part for us. 

Also the way the handle luggage wasn't that great. If one is not cautious they might loose their baggage or it might get exchanged. 

And the last thing the snacks served on the boat are way costly. so carry if you can from outside. More",May-18

A luxury liner from Port Blair to Havelock,Jai06,"Ambala, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,17-May-18,"The boats are air-conditioned and comfortable. People prone to sea-sickness would be comfortable in these boats since there is minimal roll and pitch. It feels (at worst) like an aircraft moving over a patch of slightly bumpy air. Nothing more. 

However those who like to feel the sea wind and spray in their face might be disappointed since the whole boat is enclosed and no one is allowed to go out on the deck.

Excellent Service with Short Travel Time,souvik_5,"Ronkonkoma, New York",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,29-Apr-18,"We went from Port Blair to Havelock island by the Makruzz Deluxe service. The facilities at Port Blair port were horrible with stinky restrooms which didn’t even have water. However, once we stepped inside the vessel, it was a world class experience. The leather seats were very comfortable and classy. The huge tinted windows gave great views of outside while blocking the sun. The crew were very friendly and always smiling. The restrooms were neat and clean with bath tissues. The food served were tiny, but due to rough sea, they shouldn’t serve heavy meal anyway. The vessel still moves up and down and left and right due to huge waves so you might still get sea sick (like my daughter did). However, it is still way better than regular ferry service vessels plying in this route (we had that first hand experience on our return journey). So, Makruzz is still your best choice of travel!

Amazing Ride for the first anniversary,reedipb1,"Noida, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,28-Apr-18,"We rode on the Makruzz Gold, as we found that it doesnt have much difference with Makruzz's normal ride in terms of rates. 

We travelled from Port Blair to Havelock on Deluxe and Havelock to Port Blair on Premium. 

For what its worth, if you love privacy and wish to cosy up with your family, take the Deluxe tickets. Its worth the money as it includes a good view, privacy and food as well. 
Premium tickets have more seats, so there is more crowd there. 
Its definetely cheaper than the Deluxe tickets, and doesnt have the snacks option, but has good view of the sea from the window seats) 

Makruzz travels at a much faster speed( takes 1.5 instead of 3 hours by Govt Ferry ) so I will recommend Makruzz for ANdaman Travels More",Apr-18

The staff and services on board are excellent. I forgot to collect change 470rs from their cafeteria while on my way back to Port Blair from Neil. I realised this when I reached A&N airport.

We had traveled by Premium Class which is located on the below deck - not below Sea Level. It has a good view of the Sea. The Check-In process was smooth with helpful Makruzz team members. 

On both the occasion, the cruise was on time both departure and arrival. The seating for the Premium class is divided into first twelve rows of 3 * 3 each with a wide passage in between. For the back rows, it is a 6*6 but with a table in between to have snacks as well. 

The snacks are reasonably priced with Coffee and Tea @Rs. 30. Sandwiches around RS. 100, Chocolates at MRP and Cold drinks at 10% over MRP. 

The Deluxe class have priority check-in and check-out and have better views of the sea. The cruise is air conditioned and there is no room for complaint.

The handing over of luggage to the alighting passengers needs to be made more systematic.....Else everything is good.",Apr-18
Great punctual ferry services,Abhishek T,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,02-Apr-18,"I took Makruzz to travel to and fro between Havelock island and port blair and both times, the ferry left right on time and reach well before time. The interiors are very comfortable and the boat doesn't roll or pitch a lot. 
The online seat selection was disappointing though. It showed seats are blocked even though they were available when we actually travelled.",Mar-18
Efficient but boring,Cojoncio,"Panchkula, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,01-Apr-18,"Out of the two ferry companies, Makruzz is more like being in a huge aeroplane than being in a ship, there is no experience of being at sea at all. You are stuck in your seat throughout the journey and cannot walk around or go out on deck to enjoy the panorama of the sea. There are windows but you cannot see very much out of them as they are shaded and spattered with salt and if you are sitting in the central section you cannot see anything at all. In short it is a boring way to travel, just a way of getting from place to place without any enjoyment, unless you are totally uninterested in your surroundings and are happy just sitting and watching Bollywood song and dance sequences on the TV. I only went on it because the Green Ocean sailing was cancelled. The saving grace is that the journey is quick. More",Mar-18
Green Ocean is way better.,JaiswalAshish,"Ghaziabad, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,31-Mar-18,"Its just a hype, Green Ocean is far better than it. It was like fish market inside.

The other operator being the Green Ocean. I had a chance to try both of them on my visit to Andamans. I would say Makruzz has got a more modern fleet of Catamarans, and takes considerably less time in between islands.

An integral part of Andaman Visit,Sudhir B,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,26-Mar-18,"The company operated several vessels. The arrangements up to the vessels are nicely handled even though you are apprehensive on the 1st look. 

Your luggage is absolutely safe...no apprehension of theft....neither inside the company premises nor on the public roads outside. Hiring a porter for the luggage is advised if you are with kids & elders. Company provides good loading facilities at Neil Island betty but unfortunately this good practice has not been replicated at Port Blair & Havellock. 

The Seating, ambience & air conditioning inside is very pleasent. TV screens may provide you insights about Tom Alter guiding you to several decent locations here...which you are usually unlikely to visit..because of time constraints. Management may prefer Song & Dance videos from Hindi films but if you are enthusiastic enough, you may request for the documentary. 

The sea outside is TOO clean and the crowd & ambience inside is a good family environment....all safe.

We travelled in deluxe category. They offered a complementary veg roll. Food and snacks are very costly in this ferry. There are three sections in this ferry are Premium, Deluxe and Royal. Sometimes the Deluxe sections are not so much booked. So we can have a comfortable journey when we travelled in this category. Tickets for advance booking opens only before a month of journey date. So we should regularly monitor the Makruzz website for online booking.

Transportation to Havelock Island,KANewYork,"New York City, New York",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,20-Mar-18,"Makruzz is a private ferry company. They ply between Port Blair and Havelock as well as Neil island. They run about twice a day. We booked the tickets online. They don’t taker American Express. The website doesn’t say it, but if you input the card info it won’t go through and you have to start again from the beginning. 
Boarding at Port Blair for the 2 pm ferry to havelock was fairly easy. I do have to say the the staff from our resort on havelock made the process easier. The ferry doors close before start and you can’t go out on deck during the ride. 
On our way in to Havelock, we had a more expensive ticket and seats upstairs. Here we were given a snack and a fruity drink. 
Coming back to Port Blair we had the less expensive lower deck. Here you can buy snacks from them. 
The journey takes about 1.5 hours and is fairly comfortable. Check ferry timings as things may change. We were put in a different one from what we booked, coming back. It left 20 mins later. More",Mar-18

Neat and clean toilets , similar to ones on a plane ; snacks and soft drinks available for sale on board. They do not check or scan luggage so best to take some alcoholic drinks from Port Blair ( which has a couple of wine shops - remember they shut between 12 and 3pm most days ) when visiting any of the islands , as they are expensive and only available on some days! No need to go for the most expensive seats , mid price is pretty good, about 2500 for two , one way between Havelock and Port Blair. More",Mar-18
An experience in itself,Fairytale-Studios,India,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Mar-18,"We had a great time while travelling in Makruzz. The first glimpse of the vessel took our breadth away. We did not expect it to be so huge. They play an important role in inter-island transfer between major Andaman Islands.

The onboard staff is always there inside the ship to help. 

They currently have 3 vessels – MV Makruzz, Makruzz Gold and coastal cruise. They run each day in both directions: Port Blair – Neil Island – Havelock Island – Port Blair and vice versa - once in morning and in evening. The timings of the departure can be checked on their websites. The ships sail from Phoenix Bay jetty in Port Blair. Havelock and Neil Islands have one single jetty only. It takes about 1-1.5 hour to reach one island from the other. Makruzz has 2 decks – lower and upper. Transparent glass windows run through the whole vessel. The Premium seats are in lower deck and Deluxe and Royal seats are in the upper deck. Both the decks have sufficient lavatories. Makruzz Gold is much more larger and much more luxurious compared to MV Makruzz. We traveled on both of them and loved both. 

It is recommended to book the seats in advance through Makruzz website and carry a print out and a valid ID proof. Seat allocation is done during reservation itself. Ensure that you arrive at least 1 hour prior to your departure for security check and check-in process. The luggage can be checked-in same way as in flights whereas hand luggage can be carried with oneself. On arrival, luggage is handed to you on the jetty. 

We would suggest reading all such details with photographs in our blog to make the most of your Makruzz trip. It is delightful to have such well-maintained vessels and world class service in India. Even the foreigners we interacted with were impressed with everything just like us. We would definitely recommend traveling with them while in Andaman. Every rupee is definitely worth it.

We took the Makruzz gold from Port Blair to Havelock and the ride was smooth and perfect. There is also another Makruzz (non gold) which runs at a different time. Had Heard that Gold was the best cruise and certainly it was. It has a pretty good canteen on board as well. 

There is a check-in process just like 
Airlines post which you have to deposit the luggage at one of the ship's gate.You need to collect back the same once you deboard.

We had Markruzz gold from port Blair .It was so clean so luxurious very nice comfortable leather seats, ac , food included in the package and they even give you blankets if you start feeling cold.They and three classes premium , deluxe and last one was like business class with separate seating and more comfortable;e recliner chairs . 
Difference between the premium and deluxe is the floor but doesn't really make any difference. 
From Havelock we had makruzz not gold .It wasn't as luxurious as the gold but wasn't bad though.

A wavy journey,Exploreu15,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,19-Feb-18,"We took the services of makruzz thrice. (Portblair to Havelock, Havelock to Neil and Neil to Portblair). This ship has two classes ( deluxe - upper deck and premium- lower deck). 
Deluxe seat is more comfortable than premium since one doesn't feel the wavy and little discomforting sea journey. 
In premium seat, one can feel the wavy journey because it is closer to the sea surface compared to deluxe seat. 
One who is sensitive to the road travel can feel discomfort while traveling in premium. 
Waves are quite large and this makruzz cuts through it and maintains the speed which in turn helps you reach the destination in time.",Feb-18
Make booking environment friendly!,BattieO,Adelaide,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,18-Feb-18,"We used makruzz cruises thrice (PB to Havelock, Havelock to Neil and Neil to PB). The cruise itself is nice. It's clean and comfortable (the food which is available in the deluxe class is very average though). The trip from Havelock to Neil was extremely bumpy and pretty much everyone in the cruise was sea sick. The staff did go around handing out sickness bags but they didn't turn off the loud music even when asked and it made things worse. My complaint however, is with the way booking is done. Online bookings are cheaper as you don't have to pay extra for printouts. If you plan and book online beforehand, you can take a printout for free at home. But the cheaper tickets are almost always not available. The only seats available online are in the higher class. So you are forced to book either the higher class or you book in their office. And they insist on a printout in this day and age when even airlines and railways are ok with showing itineraries on the phone. And of course it's not free. They charge Rs50 extra per ticket even though they give you only one printout. And having said this, in our trip from PB to Havelock, our co-passenger (a white passenger) didn't have a printout and got away with showing the itinerary on her phone. This is totally ok with us as it's environment friendly but... We used makruzz cruises thrice (PB to Havelock, Havelock to Neil and Neil to PB). The cruise itself is nice.

Fast -costly and hence adding to sea sickness,coer_ankit,"Chandigarh, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,05-Jan-18,"Well, MAkruzz and green ocean are two services apart from Govt Ferry. Makruzz takes about 1:30 Hrs b/t port blair to havelock -1 hr less than govt ferry. But because of its speed, slight roughness of sea can lead to the complete batch of passengers to go sea-sick. In our case, whole ship was vomiting after 30 minutes of sailing. While I de boarded the ship at port blair, had a chat with passenger from green ocean of same date and time, and he informed me that no such incident happened at green ocean. 

Another thing is that, seats are normally available even during peak season. If you look at seat availability 3-4 days in advance of journey, you may see that no or very less no of seats is available but if you look at seats availability for next day, you will be shocked to see a great no of seats. It is because of travel agents who blocks the seat for their expected customers and release them one day in advance, if they dnt find any. More",Dec-17

The wash rooms were filthy. No medical facility nothing!! Just 30-45min before the end of journey things became better as the motion sickness reduced due to calm water.

A premiere ticket offers no special services and seats are not reclining, costing between Rs 1000-1200/person. But they do have a cafe in the lower deck. 
A deluxe ticket also offers you a sandwich and a water bottle along with a partial reclining seats; costing between Rs 1400-1600/person. These seats are on the upper deck. 
Royal seats are on the upper deck only (along with deluxe seats) inside an isolated VIP room. Seats are full reclining and they provide a snack box with tea/coffee; costing between Rs 2400-2600/person. 
I would recommend travelling in a premier class only since the journey is short (only of 1-1.5 hrs) so you don't need reclining seats for your travel, and you get more options for snack(s) at their cafe. More",Dec-17
New experience,Subhro_Jana,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,21-Dec-17,"This is the second time I visited Andaman. First time was in 2011, that time there was no cruise. 
I found there are pros and cons of Makruzz over government ferry. 

Makruzz is convenient in getting bookings online, but for ferries you get tickets only before 3 days of travel and at time there is issues with the connections. 
Makruzz takes lesser time to cover the same distance. 
But some how I still feel the experience of standing on the deck of government ferry and traveling is something different. And I really missed that in Makruzz, as they don't allow you to the deck. And more over as you are always confined in the cabin throughout your travel you get to experience more rolling and chances of sea sickness is more. More",Nov-17
Expensive and cold,Simona K,"Ljubljana, Slovenia",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,20-Dec-17,"I did not prefer Markuzz compared to governmental transport, which is much cheaper. One have to stay inside, and the air-condition is set absolutely too low make people freezing.",Nov-17
Jumpy ride,bilala586,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,20-Dec-17,Makruzz ferry is one of the few modes of transportation available to get to and from Havelock and Niel's islands. The ferry is well maintained and the staff/crew are helpful. Depending on the sea conditions the ride can be choppy and would even give sea sickness to people with strong stomachs. Ride is enjoyable though.,Dec-17
best way to travel,sans_gh,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Dec-17,"the best option to travel between islands. on time, clean, helpful staff.. should be your first option to travel with",Dec-17
Cool and comfortable way to navigate islands,ShakirSharfrazA,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Dec-17,"The air conditioning is a great boon to escape the tropical sun. The glass windows do not compromise the great view of the blue shallows. The ferry may gave bouncy when the what is choppy. Otherwise, the ride is totally smooth. There is an in-ferry canteen for your hungry stomach. But the items are little over-priced. The view of the blue waters and white sand of islands when the ferry pulls away from the marina makes you nostalgic that you are leaving it! 
We booked this ferry to move between Port Blair and Havelock. There was a stop in Neil Island in between!",Jan-17
Really luxurious and world class,HungryGamer,Bangalore,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,18-Dec-17,"Best mode of water transport I have ever traveled in India, few salient points 

Catamaran design - increases speed at the same time reducing vibration , hardly feel travelling on water - much faster than their rival Green Ocean 
Wide windows in all classes offering superb view of the ocean 
Spick and span - really clean ships 
Clean and hygienic toilets 
Good enough snacking options available on board 
Courteous staff and cruises always depart and arrive as per schedule 
Online booking available along with easy check in to the cruise 
Good connectivity across islands in Andaman",Dec-17
Flight kind of experience,amichemie2016,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,17-Dec-17,By Makruzz you can go to Havelock and Neil Island. The total time taken is 2-3 hrs. In this you will have a flight type of experience. There's a Cafe also in this ship. Charges for one way Rs 1100/- for Havelock Island. The seats are comfortable in Deluxe class. In premiere class it was like a dining table type sitting arrangement. 6 people on one table. The photo I have attached is of deluxe class.,Nov-17
Terrible crew members Dont Book!!,YashVardhanR97,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,17-Dec-17,"Booked Royal class tickets for 3 sectors paying 40,000 INR. The crew is highly unprofessional, rude and arrogant. Tried to shift someone else into Royal class without proper reservations, allowed some passengers in restricted wheelhouse area, no safety instructions in Royal class and totally ignorant about refreshments. 
Pathetic services. Vessel is very nice but crew needs to be replaced. Crew is TARNISHING the image of Makruzz.",Dec-17
Good for Travel to Various Islands,Shammi S,"Dehradun, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,17-Dec-17,We had taken this for travel to Havelock Island. It has an upper deck and a lower deck. Upper deck being premium they serve snack meal. Cafe is there on the lower deck which is fairly priced. It was a smooth journey. The ship is well maintained and the crew is professional,Nov-17
roller coaster ride,khadds,kabul,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,14-Dec-17,"sea is CHOPPY but safe, these were the words that ship captain told us in beginning. Probably for most of us it was first or second ship ride, but it was terrible. Ship moving up and down was night mare for all of us. Out of 250 passenger, more than half were vomiting and rest were stunned. Their office in Havelock has minimal facilities and need improvement. The portblair office s better, but can be further improved. Journey from port blair to havelock was gud as sea was calm. People havin motion sickness should definitely take avomine b4 boarding.",Dec-17
Lots of cockroach on board,SavonaTravellover,"Silvassa, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,13-Dec-17,The makruzz ships have many fleet some are good in condition but found cockroach on board. They are not maintaining the luggage properly. Staff are not providing feedback form after asking.,Dec-17
Do not consume water or heavy eatable before taking ride...,Amitabh_Telang,"Varanasi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,13-Dec-17,"Yes, it was a great experience to travel with Macruz. Very comfortable seats. Helpful and cheerful staff. Our journey was almost cancelled due to bad sea condition....at last moment they decided to ply. 

Warning: Do not take liquids and heavy breakfast before the journey. Do take anti vomiting pills at least an hour before the journey. 95% fellow travelers vomited badly during the journey except my family. 

Tip: Open the folding table attached to front seat. Hold it tightly and bend and keep your head on your hands. Do not put whole pressure on the table or else it will break. The idea is to keep your stomach as fixed as you can and close your eyes. It will surely help you to avoid vomiting. 

Extra Tip: Ask your hotel restaurant to pack your breakfast. You can consume it upon arriving to Havelock/Neil. You will only enjoy for first 20 mins and last 20 mins when ferry enters into calm waters. Otherwise it is a roller coaster ride for 1.5 hours (which may scare you also). More",Dec-17
"Neat, clean and nice staff",mishab846,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,09-Dec-17,"Well the best decision was to sit in this ferry. We chose this for our ride till Havelock this year. Macruzz has neat and clean interiors, well maintained and warm staff. Though the eatables being sold inside were a little expensive but keeping in mind the time taken, speed and keeping the guests comfortable... It did a great job overall. I would always prefer to travel through this. We were in gold class which was on the top with a big window and could see the entire view. While coming bk we even got packaged eateries (sandwiches and Juice) to savour on. It was right on time (both ways) which I liked the most. Otherwise it generally depends on the weather how and wat time the cruises leave for havelock islands. More",Feb-17

Basically it is a closed vessel ship and you cannot go on the roof. Very net & clean ship, centrally air conditioned and speed also fine. Seats are also OK. You are to book advance ticket so that any problem does not arise on the journey day. We availed the premium class which was very nice, spacious and silent. The crew members also looked fine. You are deposit the luggage as we do for air travel and after reaching destination collect the luggage. About 01 hour time takes from Havlock to Neil. After getting the ticket, you are to take take boarding pass [Simply put their seal & seat number on the ticket paper itself ] You are carry the I-card during boarding pass & entry.

Lovely Cruise.,137ashutoshj,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,05-Dec-17,"We took the Makruzz while on our way to Havlock Island. It was the very time we were to try such a huge ship which can board around 360 passenger and can cruise over 60KM in 1.5 hours.

Nice modern vessel...beware of a choppy journey !!!,Richa D,Delhi,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,03-Dec-17,"Amazing experience. Makruzz have nice, new, modern, well maintained vessels for travel from and to Port Blair, Havelock and Neil Islands. The journey from PB to Havelock takes 2 hrs. Preferably keep your tummy as light or empty as possible as the ride can be really rough and rocking due to choppy sea and unpredictable weather around the islands. With full stomach, sea sickness becomes aggravated. 
Makruzz can really improve the videos they play inside the cabin. It will help the travellers immensely to combat their sea sickness. Seriously, the music videos sucked and made the journey more miserable.",Nov-17

Interesting and good,Shreenivas S,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,30-Nov-17,"I traveled in 2 different vessels of Makruzz. One ship was clean with good seats and well maintained toilets while the other was old and the washrooms were very dirty. Both vessels are super fast and it was a unique experience. The staff and crew are not very professional although they try to make you feel as if in an aircraft. While many people suffer from sea sickness en route, the crew distribute sea sickness bags frequently and manage the situation well. Luggage handling can be managed better as the passenger has to either carry it till the vessel or hire a porter. Giving a complimentary bottle of water to each passenger wont cause a revenue loss to them. Minus all the shortcomings, this is a good experience in Andamans for traveling from PB-Havelock- Neil Island-PB. More",Nov-17

Markuzz gold is luxurious vessel. Try getting seats near the window and carry packed food. Food inside is overpriced.

The interiors are quite good, spacious and comfortable. Big screen TVs provide entertainment. There is also a small cafe for beverages and light snacks. 

However, we observed the following issues: 
1. They cancel their trips unexpectedly 
2. Their staff was clueless as to which seats to provide to us and some other families. We waited for almost 30-45 mins after the cruise had started to get our seats, and they kept making us run across the upper and the lower decks in search of seats.

"She sails, she sails on the blue sea",Pinaki S,Kolkata,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,31-Oct-17,A very comfortable ride and there was no “rolling” at all and obviously no sea sickness. Advisable to travel on the upper deck in a deluxe class and great to have a window seat. The cruise is clean and the upper deck is less crowded as the number of seats are less. Adequate wash rooms are provided. Acafetaria is available on the lower deck and breakfast should never be an issue. Passengers in the deluxe class is provided with light refreshments.

Also unlike Govt ferry they won't allow you to go to deck to enjoy sea view outside.

Makruzz - A comprehensive review,dawar_sun,"Panipat District, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,29-Oct-17,"1. Booking tickets - Start writing emails to makruzz team asking them when will they open ticket booking for the period you want tickets. 
Once they let you know .. keep checking the site and book quickly .. all tickets get sold in 1 hr. 

2. Boarding- After entering the phoenix jetty makruzz crew will help you for luggage and you will be taken to boarding point by bus . ( Pics shown for luggage and bus) 

3. Visit the makruzz counter near boarding point for ticket check in - pic attached. For morning 8 am, boarding starts at 7:20 am. 

4. It's a clean comfortable and premium ferry, runs on time it left port Blair at 7:55 in morning while time was 8 am and reaches havelock at 9:25. 

5. Seating arrangement is very good even better than planes. Lower deck - premium seats (200+) , upper deck - deluxe (50+) + royal (5-8) 
Less people on upper deck but views better from premium.

Not so memorable journey,satyakimukherjee2017,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,26-Oct-17,"I travelled in Makruzz from Havelock Island to Port Blair on 08.10.17 with my family and parents. The interior of the vessel is clean and well decorated. The cruise is smooth without any problem related to sea wave. I want to highlight two problems which I did not like: 
1. The TV inside the vessel continuously delivers garbage filmi songs at high volume. It should be replaced by documentaries on Andaman & Nicobar. Since most of the travellers are tourists, it will make their journey memorable. 
2. Only small bags can be kept with the travellers. For bigger bags, there should be a registered baggage handling system with baggage handed over to crew against a baggage receipt. No bagggage receipt was given to me, in fact the crew were extremely rude when I asked for baggage receipt. After reaching at Port Blair I found my baggage lying unattended on the jetty. Anybody could have picked my bag and taken it away. Hence I request authorities to be careful on this issue. More",Oct-17

The elegance and luxury of the liner makes the journey really enjoyable. I took Makruzz from Port Blair to Havelock island and then to Neil island. Everything was really nice about the cruise including its interiors, staff, refreshments, entertainment and toilets. The only let-down was the tremendous mismanagement of luggage collection once the ship reached the jetty. No tokens were issued against one's luggage at the starting point although there was strict security checking. The entire luggage was dumped on the jetty on arrival at the destination. Everybody went completely berserk in trying to locate their belongings and more so because there were several similar looking bags and suitcases. Complete pandemonium prevailed at that time. This happened both the times we had to disembark. Either there should be some kind of conveyor belt or some kind of cordoning to prevent passengers from pouncing on the suitcases. I hope the Makruzz management will look into this to make the entire experience perfect. More",Sep-17

The only problem of private Cruz is that in inclement weather and due to issues on boat they can cancel the Cruz last money Also. Going so far and if you specially want to visit havelock and neil it's better you keep backup bookings in govt ferries as well. 

Govt ferry tickets are very difficult to get as locals use often. But as ur travel agent to book u on government ferries as aa backup lest you get suprised once you travel all the way to port Blair. You might spend on that extra ticket but it's worth keeping that backup lest you leave andamans on a bitter note not able to visit the famed HV and N islands.

Booking process is a nightmare/let the local pros handle it,Constantlyontheroad,"Hong Kong, China",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,07-Oct-17,"Makruzz has positives like cleanliness, comfort while on board and an efficient loading/unloading system. It also appeared to be quite reliable in terms of its schedule while I was in town. However all of this is overshadowed by the booking process. Firstly, you should really buy through an agent in order to secure your ticket. Secondly, although the website allows for online bookings, the company is not transparent about when tickets become available. There is no consistency in terms of the timing of the release (e.g. One month in advance). You have to keep emailing them to ask and often the dates they give you are not accurate so you have to message them again. And perhaps again.. you get the point. Even when you do manage to get the right release date, all of the tickets are almost immediately snapped up by the agents. Thirdly, try and book early. Right now some of Makruzz's ships are being repaired. This means that capacity is an issue before we even take into account the size of the ship that is running which is smaller than its sister boats. One of Green Ocean's boats is also being repaired. So given that there is a lot of demand and capacity constraints, you should try and get your travel dates broadly nailed down and tickets booked well in advance (where possible/sometimes this just isn't possible).

In the event that it gets very close to your departure time (even up to a couple of hours before) and you still don't have a ticket as long as you are aligned with a good agent then it is likely that the they will do their best to help you sort something out. That may involve shifting to the government ferry. 

The entire booking process and notification could and should be overhauled which would make things so much simplier and enjoyable but it is what it is so as long as you know what you are dealing with then you will be fine.

But Macruzz played the spoilsport to our dream trip. We went through all the ferries available from PB to HVL, and Macruzz seemed the best option, it looked luxurious, had great reviews, and it used to take only 1.5 hours for the journey. Hence we booked the tickets from PB to HVL for 21st September 2017, and HVL to PB for 23rd of September 2017. It cost us 11000 Rs. but we were happy to shell out that for the luxury, convenience, and certainty it offered, as we had two small kids with us. We reached PB on 19th September 2017 around 12:30 PM, and went straight to visit Ross Island as next day was a Wednesday and Ross Island remains closed on Wednesdays. We checked into our hotel at around 4:30 PM and then decided to confirm our ferry tickets with Macruzz as mentioned in the ticket. When I called the number mentioned in the ticket, they mentioned that the ferry has been canceled. We were little shocked as no one informed us about the same, and it was 19th September 5 PM. This meant that we had to travel after one day in the ferry, and no one from Macruzz felt it important to inform us. Hotel staff suggested going to Macruzz office which was nearby.

When I called the number mentioned in the ticket, they mentioned that the ferry has been canceled. We were little shocked as no one informed us about the same, and it was 19th September 5 PM. This meant that we had to travel after one day in the ferry, and no one from Macruzz felt it important to inform us. Hotel staff suggested going to Macruzz office which was nearby. We went there and literally begged them for alternate arrangements mentioning the two small kids were traveling with us and we had already made hotel and flight bookings worth more than 1 lakh Rs, but they had only one reply that the ferry was canceled due to some technical reason, and there was not much that they could do. This was the response from the ferry which boasts of being the most luxurious one in Andamans. They did not have time to inform their customers about the cancellation of the ferry and made no efforts for the alternate arrangement. 

With no hope left, we thought of trying our luck at other ferries like Green Ocean, government ferry etc, but they were all booked. We started running from one agent shop to another and offered them as much money as they wanted, but every one of them made the same point that all the tickets were already booked as local agents knew about Macruzz cancelation from 17th September, and they all blocked the tickets to accommodate their passengers. So we were two days late, all because Macruzz did not feel it important to inform their customers about the cancellation. We were completely hopeless after that, and 99% sure that our trip was ruined. 

We thought of trying our luck in government ferry from the counter and went there next day morning. We got the same response there that no tickets were available. My father decided to contact some higher official in the government and finally, he was able to arrange for tickets for us in the government ferry. But this wasted our complete day in Port Blair, as we did nothing but going from one place to another place looking for ferry tickets, and ferry was scheduled 2 PM next day which meant our next day was also wasted as we would reach Havelock at 5 PM, and there would be nothing much to do. But we were in no state to complain, as we were finally going to Havelock. 

But this callous and insensitive attitude of Macruzz left me saddened, and ponder over the customer service we get in India even after paying such a hefty amount. I remember one of the executives mentioning point 11 of their terms and conditions 
""The carrier reserves the right to cancel or change the published voyage for any official purpose and in any manner or to any extent. The carrier shall bear no liability 
for any loss that passenger may suffer, any consequences thereof or in respect of any changes in scheduled due to Bad weather or Technical reasons, In this case passenger can either claim full refund or can reschedule His/her Journey on availability"" 

So this literally means that they can cancel their ferry any time, and there is nothing a passenger can do rather than ruining their trip. Please note that a family might have already spent more 1-1.5 lack on the trip, but the whole trip is ruined if the ferry is canceled. I really wonder what is the need to pre-book tickets, if there is no certainty, and no alternate arrangements being made. Also, Green Ocean informed us that Macruzz had booked around 50 tickets from them, and they were accommodating few important customers. Perhaps we were not that important to them. But at least they should have informed us much earlier rather than when we going to inquire about the status. Even a mass SMS drive would have worked, and provided us enough time to look for alternate arrangements. They sent us the SMS the moment we came out of their office on the 19th evening to absolve them of any responsibility. This meant they had the option of sending the messages earlier as well, but they didn't care. We met several passengers in flight during our returning journey who could not go to Havelock due to Macruzz cancellation and had to stay in PB only for all of their days. We lost two days but lucky enough to save our trip. Only if Macruzz had informed us on its own or made alternate arrangements, our trip would have been much better, but as their terms and condition says their is no certainty if even you have the confimed tickets.

Comfortable way of travelling,AngelaV2909,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,14-Sep-17,"Makruzz, I understand us the best way to get yourself transferred from one island to the other in Andaman. The check in process is very smooth. Please do remember to carry your photo identity proof at the check in counter. The process is very similar to an airport check in with baggage screening and frisking. 
The interior is well maintained and the 333seats are arranged on two levels. The lower level has seats which are a bit cramped with the central wing having seven seats. The best part of the lower level is that the cafe is here and you get more than decent fare. The cupcakes were yummy. 
The upper deck is much more spacious and airy (72 seats) with the central wing having 3 seats and both sides housing two seats. If you need leg space opt for the first two rows. Food is also served here. The upper deck houses a vip room also. The view from the upper level is much better. Rest rooms are available on both levels. 
Ticket costs for the deck from port blair to havelock was 1050 per person. 
The seats are comfortable and the staff very pleasant and helpful. Remember to book your tickets on the deck. More",Sep-17

Given the fact that it had been raining continuously for a couple of days, the ferry should not have sailed, seeing the weather conditions. If they did not know the conditions, then they should have checked before sailing. They should be aware that they are responsible for each and every life on the vessel (that day it was fully filled with 280 people on board).

Either way, after countless enquiries for over 3 months, I managed to book 2 trips for Aug 2017. One from PB to HL and then the return. The first one was pretty good. The whole check-in process conducted by the jetty officials was smooth. The final check in counter where the Makruzz officials checked and stamped your tickets was, however, a mess. Only 1 counter handling 280 tickets and another collecting 50 bucks extra per person as Port Service Fees which was surprising neither charged nor mentioned in most tickets.

Avoid taking front row seats cause in deluxe class there is the captain's room in front you and in premium, you don't get any front view cause most people leave their seats and come up front to click photos and selfies! 
Now coming to the second voyage. There is hardly any checking when boarding from Havelock. Everything happened smoothly till we boarded the ship and it refused to sail. Apparently, there were 280 seats on board but over 300 tickets had been issued, some with duplicate seat numbers! And mind you, they were all legal tickets issued by the company and not by any tout or 3rd party! Thus started an enormous debate/fight which took over an hour to settle. And all this while, no announcement was made, nor an apology forwarded for the delay! Talk about unprofessionalism! To make matters worse, the voyage was one of the worst I have ever undertaken. The sea was calm, yet the boat rocked like an empty box. Was it some technical problem or was it due to the sailors trying to make up for lost time, I do not know. Quite a few passengers threw up due to the sea-sickness which ensued. And we ended up arriving over an hour late. Quite a few passengers apparently missed their flight as well.

The twin hull is much fastest than its counterparts- Green Ocean and the public ferry. However, getting tickets is pretty hard online as the systems used have poor internet connectivity and the software is outdated. The Managment must look into this as the entire booking process is tedious and pain staking. Furthermore on the way back from havelock, we were told that the tickets have been overbooked and that the crew refused to initially let us on board. We had to fight our way in even after having confirmed tickets bought in advance. Then we were told to stand on the journey from havelock to Neil before some passengers offloaded and we were given seats to the connection to port Blair.

It takes less time to travel is the only benefit on Makkruz. One cannot go out in open on this ship. Of course, a lot of people will prefer traveling in an air conditioned locked cabin, I personally do not like it. 

I prefer government ferry which gives a much better feel of traveling by ship to different islands. Not only it is cheap but also fun; if you get lucky and there is not too much rush you can get to the bridge of the ship and enjoy the really good view of ocean travel. More",Jul-17

For the level of operations, they are maintaining it very well. A Completely sealed ac ferry where in you can enjoy the scenic beauty of the sea through the glass window. No peeping allowed. 

Ferry is well maintained .cost in the shop is not over priced and is same as main land. courteous staff.. But few things shocked me and if the management sees the reviews, it would be good for them to thinkover. 

1. When the port staff themselves dont ask for a printout of the ticket at the security check, it looked really funny when the makruzz staff charges 50 per booking as printing charges for entering into the cruise. i did not see a logic there at all. 

2. Also, when we called the office from havelock, they said all 1000 rupees tickets were sold out, but when checked at the office later, there were plenty available.They try to push the higher price tickets.This happens with few of their booking officers and be careful with it. 

Barring the few negatives, there's no doubt that this is best available in terms of comfort, leg room . 

at any point of time, we cannot compare makruzz with government ferry. Government ferry is way cheaper, harder to get tickets , but would allow you to venture out and enjoy the andaman islands which makruzz shall not provide. More",Jun-17

Best part is that advance tickets were available and the timings were perfect compared to the scary reviews about other ferries where you can't have the advance booking and the travel is dependent on the weather mostly. Reach the jetty at least one hour early and be ready for the airport like check in with security. Be ready to walk a little or take the small bus (complimentary) to make you reach close to the boarding gate and ferry. People guide you to your seats. Security drill mandatory for the ferry is also televised with additional tourist information, which is needed. The seaway is beautiful with hills around you and clean water. It does not make you feel dizzy. The glasses are tinted to avoid the bright sun but to give you full view around. The cabin is air-conditioned. You can have the choice of three different classes depending on what you wish to. A restaurant on board is not expensive and would be good enough for having a good breakfast or a drink or a snack.

Perfect way to travel to Havelock Island,yashwantdeewan,New Delhi,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-May-17,There are two options available if you want to visit Havelock from Port Blair. First option is to take Government Ship or Ferry to travel to Havelock which offers this two hours journey in about Rupees 500-600. But you will feel like you are sitting in a godown. So will not prefer the Government ship. Second option is to take private cruise like Makruzz or Green Ocean. I chose Makruzz. Very courteous staff and nice ambience. I'll say value for money.,May-17
Makruzz a Comfortable way for Havelock,Ithinkforyou,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,23-May-17,If you have to go to Havelock then makruzz is the best option.

Poor management in handling luggage,az_n05,"Pune, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,21-May-17,"Took makruzz to and fro havelock and both times ferry was more than 1.5 hours late leading to late eve check-in to hotels. Please do not take risks of catching flight. These ferries may get canceled or delayed and you do not get any notification. The ferry is clean with comfortable seats, 4-5 washrooms but chilling AC. There will be documentaries on andaman or cartoons playing on LCDs. People are not allowed to go out of cabin. The wavy ride may cause sea-sickness/vomiting to people. Better keep yourself engaged with something. I took upper deck class both ways which is less crowded and is in pattern of 2X3X2. I preselected seats during booking a month back but while coming back from havelock at checkin they re-alloted totally different and uncomfortable seats. Complimentary snacks was to laugh at (a roll equal to finger size and a frooti). Luggage checkin is good and smooth at port blair but at havelock you yourself have to hand it over to ferry crew. Now comes most pathetic part, the disembarking of your luggage both at havelock and portblair. They just put it out on the jetty and it becomes a fish market. People jumping over each other to spot and grab their luggage and ferry crew pushing people away and shouting on them to make place for more luggage to come out.

Best avl option to travel between main islands at Andaman & Nicobar,OliveSamanta,"Calcutta, West Bengal, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,18-May-17,"The ferries mainly travel between Port Blair, Havelock & Neil. Except Makruzz the other 2 options are Greenline & Govt Ferry. Makruzz is the best avl option in respect to speed & comfortability. It normally takes 90-105 mins between Port Blair & havelock & 60 mins between Havelock & Neil. Makruzz have 2 vessels- Makruzz & Makruzz Gold. Comfortability wise (like seats etc) Gold is better but speed wise Makruzz is better. But dont expect punctuality, systematic luggage handling, comfortable boarding etc from any of the 3 options. Makruzz is a fully enclosed AC vessel, unlike Greenline & Govt Ferry (in these 2 u can roam on deck also). You can appoint a travel agent to book your Makruzz tickets OR can manage on your own directly from their website. Fares of Makruzz is slightly higher than the other 2 options. But ride is smooth enough if the weather is not bad. They have 3 classes- Royal, delux & premium. Premium is on the lower deck & the other 2 on the higher deck. Royal class is actually within the delux class but enclosed in a cabin where 8 passengers can accomodate. But if you want to enjoy the views, the best recomended class is delux. I would have rated 5 if they worked punctually & systamatically. Otherwise as i mentioned this is the best avl option in A&N. More",Apr-17

Things fall apart,lingarajuds,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,13-May-17,"Macruzz is a cruise ship travels from Port Blair to Havelok and Neil island every day. Travellers have to depend on these cruise ships only. These ships have monopolised the travelling. They are collecting thousands of rupees from travellers. 
Macruz also no exception. Cruise people makes the travellers to wait for hours for the luggage check in where they did nothing. People have to stand in ques to get their tickets entered in their record. It seems that they have not tried to simplify the system. 
Travellers cannot enjoy the beauty of the sea standing on deck as the deck is closed. The cruise team should be courteous and professional. 
I suggest the Andaman Government to arrange for ships and end the monopoly. More",May-17

It is a long walk from the gate to the jetty. They have a bus service from the port entry to the boarding point for the infirm. Tickets and luggage was checked the luggage was taken care of by the staff. Luggage arrived safely at the destination. 
Arrive about an hour before the ferry time printed on the ticket as there will be long queues. No smoking or alcohol allowed aboard. You can take appropriate medications for seasickness but it will be comfortable except when the sea is really choppy.

Mak stopped its service on 15.04.17during cyclone. Though Govt ship started from 6:30 am on 16th April but Mak didnot resume its service till 12pm.

Best ferry,joywood17,"Hyderabad, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,12-Apr-17,"The fastest mode of transportation for hopping to another island.

Royal is a 8 seater private compartment in the upper deck. 
Paid snack counter is available on the lower deck.

I didn't get a window seat so the journey was pretty boring, there are 2-3 TV in the cruise with Andaman Tourism promotion. But the volume was very very low, so make sure you have some good songs in the ipod :). The downside was when we disembark from the cruise they just dump the luggage and it was not organised at all. During our return journey to Port Blair, there was not enough light to identify the luggage.So as a precaution do mark your luggage with some tag(cruise do not provide) to uniquely identify your stuff.

It was around 2 hour’s trip. We are pleasantly welcomed by the hostess there, and showed our seats. We felt as if we were in an airplane. Fortunately, we got the front row, in the premium section. The air conditioning inside was nice. Seats were clean. Cruising was very smooth. It was indeed a rare experience as we travelled for the first time in a ferry like this. If we compare the Mak group vessels like Coastal Cruise, Makruzz is far better than the other ferries. 

The audio visual presentation was extremely good, clear and graphic in description, which can be understood even by a school-going kid. On seeing this, we thought of giving a suggestion to the Indian Government to adapt this type of presentation both in Hindi and English in the cellular jail, instead of the light and sound presentation, which is an outmoded one 

Snacks section is ok, and the luggage transmission is manual and good. Cleanliness inside the ferry deserves appreciation. Restroom needs replacement. Sailing was smooth without jerks.

Trust me, the cruise is fast and if you have sea sickness, avoid taking this Cruise. The Cruise is unlike any other as it is completely enclosed within AC windows (riveted) with no view decks and hence you end up seated during the whole ride of 90 mins. Don't dare to get off from your seat as you would surely lose your balance and find yourself on the floor or over other passengers.

It's packed and air conditioning is weak. So bumpy ride causes sea sickness and along with lack of ventilation it causes majority of people to vomit. Even if you don't feel like vomiting, other people around you start vomiting and you give up. 
The on board snacks provided are pretty average in quality and catalyst to vomiting. 
You can't enjoy sea view as it's closed. 
Avoid it and go with any other ferry which gives you deck view More",Feb-17
"Very comfortable ride, recommend it over the Government Ferry",Shumitm,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,08-Mar-17,"Very organised, superb view of the ocean. Hardly feel the pain of sea travel. I used it for the Port blair - havelock journey. Strongly recommend",Mar-17
Need to improve customer service,HappyToTravel06,"Chennai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,07-Mar-17,"Being the only high end cruise service provided they lack in the customer service area. For the money they charge, they should be courteous and service oriented.

Lovely cruise,MS2302,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,06-Mar-17,"It was a delight to travel by this cruise. Extremely neat, well maintained and very spacious seats. The food served was average. Time taken to travel is far less than the other ferries, it took about a lil over 2 hrs to reach Post Blair from Havelock. The best part was the music they played, lovely selection of fusion music. Would any day recommend traveling by this.",Feb-17
Cruise in comfort,gudnuse,"Pune, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,05-Mar-17,"The Makruzz passenger ferries is a highly visible service in Andamans although there are other government ferries plying on scheduled routes to and from Port Blair . One gets the impression that Makruzz are running a premium service and their ships are modern ,sleek and well appointed . We took the most expensive ticket called ""Royal class "" that was a cubicle on upper deck with 8 spacious and luxurious seats with provision to recline . The said cubicle had heavily grey tinted windows that robbed us of nice views of the sea . I realized too late that it would have been better to get seats on the upper deck that were equally good and comfortable . 

The service from liveried staff was indifferent . The food packet consisted of two items of fried snacks that looked so unhealthy that I left it alone. The coffee was 10x sweet like payas . Bottomline - We had no option but remain hungry . 

Makruzz have pretensions to running a luxury ferry service but they still have a long way to go before attaining international standards in passenger comfort . In all fairness I must also say that the ferry transport they provide is a reliable service in terms of safety and punctuality . More",Feb-17
Bad online booking service,142shripadd,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,03-Mar-17,"If you are booking it online from their website you have to face so many problems. I booked it online, money got debited but they didn't give me PNR. As my trip was totally depends on its booking, I tried so hard to call them whole day and mailed them all the details but no reply to those mails, they took whole day to give PNR, dat also I need to call next day and request them for each booking. 
The worst part was when I ask PNR at Havelock ofc counter, they asked 50 rs for the print out of ticket despite the fact that they only forgot to give PNR plus when I argued with it they simply answer like you guys forgot to take print out that's why we charge 50 rs...Wohh, totally bad service in terms of booking online, be careful !

Not that great,Sigin M,"Chennai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,02-Mar-17,Itz an average vessel. When we sailed the sea was rough. So all around people were puking.. Because the vessel is light compared to green ocean there were lot of sway.. Didn't enjoy the ride at all.. More over the upper classes have packed meal which is for just the name sake.. Not worth the hype.,Feb-17
Amazing sea trip on Makruzz..,Prasobh K,"Chennai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,02-Mar-17,"Travelled in Makruzz between Port Balir & Havelock and Neil Island to Port Blair on my family vacation in January. The Makruzz offers a relaxed smooth sea ride with nice facilities & ambiance. Its fully air conditioned with plane like seating, washrooms, refreshment area, music and also a TV to play entertainment. Completely enjoyed the ride - if one gets window seats you can enjoy great views of the sea and islands as well. Only uncomfortable part was getting in to the Makruzz - on crowded days there is a lot of confusion.",Jan-17
Awesome cruise experience,avinandanghosh,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,02-Mar-17,"This was my first cruise ride, albeit for a small duration of 2hrs, but really very comfortable....the window-side seats are costing Rs.100 extra but very comfortable. The upper deck is premium which also serves snacks & more comfortable. The seats need to be pre-booked (online) to get seats as per choice...rather to get a seat. Overall, a very nice experience to travel in between Port Blair & Havelock.",Mar-17
Not that much entertaining for first time cruise Traveller,suvendu87,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,02-Mar-17,"We availed Makruzz from Havelock to Neil and from Neil to PortBlair. Our Reservations are done by our travel Agency, so we didn't go through any kind of hassles to book seats. 

The Cruise was covered in all directions. ACs are on but at the starting of your journey, You may feel vomiting due to sea motion sickness. After some time, it should be alright. 

You can only view sea from black transparent glass, there is no way you can go outside and have the feel of sea wind. You have that option in Green Ocean Cruise. 

During Havelock to Neil Island Transfer, Makruzz was late by a huge timeline. We have to adjust our schedules due to this. Makruzz was late in all journeys of us. Passenger bag services are also very poor. 

Anyways, Tourists don't have much choices.So you have to avail Makruzz. More",Feb-17
Blue Catarman Ferry,Shailesh306,"Navi Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,01-Mar-17,"The ride is smooth and very relaxing. But I do not understand why anyone would like to sit in an Air Conditioned cabin in a catarman and would like to travel on the open sea. Our reason was timing and the last minute bookings we did to travel to Andamans; hence the Makruzz. Its better to take Green Ocean Ferry as it has a roof top Disco and Bar and you can actually enjoy the fresh breeze. 
That being said it is a one time experience and if you get the opportunity grab it.",Feb-17

One can see the vacant seats, accordingly note the seat numbers and inform the company the choice of seats. You have to walk a considerable distance from the gate till the jetty. There's a waiting lounge to sit until the boat is ready for boarding. Very systematic and orderly procedure. However for checkin baggage no tags are issued. So one has to ensure a noticeable sticker in order to identify on arrival at Havelock. It's advisable to carry valuables in your hand bag. Journey was superb. Huge glass windows offer a beautiful view of the glimmering ocean. I booked for Rs 1100 per person. On the return journey I had booked online Green Ocean ferry. Here you can go on the deck. But the seating arrangements is just like a box at the executive base level where I paid Rs 900 per person. No windows at all - very dark inside - absolutely disgusting journey.

A word of caution in case you are travelling with elders- it's 1 km walk from jetty to gate and vice versa.

Experience!,Kinkar C,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-Feb-17,Cruise on the Andaman Sea on Makruzz is awesome. Some people get sea sickness but it is worth experiencing.

Just one short advice to team mackruzz is that please keep room fresheners in all class of travel as many people puke as they have sea sickness and you are aware of it. We travelled by 3 different cruise and they were late by schedule time but it's adjustable 
My advice to travellers is that they should travel by this cruise as its fast and popular but if you have sea sickness please go empty stomach or else you are sure to puke as cruise has several jerks in between which is practically not in their hands as they also have to adjust with time and speed More",Feb-17

Once you are inside the ferry you will feel like you are in nice AC bus. Cleanliness and hygiene is well maintained. Only bad part was my return ferry was delayed by 1 hour and on my return journey sea was bit rough , most of the passengers were facing seasickness problem. So if you are planning to travel with them and not used to with such conditions there is high probability of facing seasickness ,Ask for seasickness tablet before commencing voyage, they already have it onboard. Or I think Makruzz should issue this tablet to each passenger as a part of check in formalities. Because many passengers are completely unaware of it. More",Feb-17

In fact , our agent informed us that it was all sold out - But, luckily they opened a second ferry and we got tickets for it jus couples of days before ride. 

The checkin is almost like flight checkin. Once you handover luggage , you can proceed to board. Seat numbers are provided , so no confusion.Seats are big and comfortable. I saw few passengers getting sick ,there were crew members to assist them and provided sickness bags as well.Very neat and clean. 
Good experience.",Jan-17
Maccruz,Jeetkhanted,"Chennai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,02-Feb-17,It a boat that almost full during season and advanced booking should be done. It's one the most appropriate of the three ferry to travel to Havelock and Neil island,Feb-17

Avoid if you suffer from motion sickness,372vikrantS,"Chandigarh, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,31-Jan-17,"I booked makruzz for my return trip from havelock island. 
Its fab looking ferry with cool design. It also takes 1 hour less to travel from port blair to havelock or back(1.5 hrs). 
But the ride is quite bumpy and if you have motion sickness issues, then those 1.5 hrs will seem like lifetime of hell to you. There were around 4-5 people who puked in the ferry washroom itself and as many puked as soon as they deboarded. 
As the ride is bumpy, obviously they dont let you leave your seats the whole journey. 

My advice, better go for green ocean ferry, it has bit desi looks and takes 2.5 hours for same journey but its better bet....no motion sickness, no bumpy ride and best part is that they let you stand outside and enjoy the awesome ocean views. More",Jan-17
Fast but not too stable,kalravmishra,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,30-Jan-17,Their vessels are no doubt the fastest way to get around but they aren't built as heavy or strong as the govt ferries.

Fastest Ferry!!,ShitijV2,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,29-Jan-17,"The ferry is fully air conditioned and offers good view from inside and outside. It covers the distance from port blair to Havelock in around 90 minutes. Quite comfortable seating, however, the washrooms were a mess. There is a small eatery in the ferry which obviously is quite overpriced. If you book the deluxe seat, a snack box is complementary and seating is on the top deck.",Jan-17

Best Way To The Islands,infoaddict,"Bolton, UK",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,26-Jan-17,"Not easy for a foreigner to book this ferry in advance as they require your RAP number in advance and of course you don't get it until you land. We simply stated we would go straight from the airport to their office and provide it then and all worked out fine. Just had to pay an extra Rs50 for them to print our tickets.Booking in advance is really the only way to ensure you can get a seat as when we tried on the islands they were booked up for weeks ahead. 

The ferry itself was very comfortable and at times it's hard to believe you are moving. Just one tip - we didn't feel it was necessary to be at the harbour for an hour in advance in Port Blair. More",Oct-16

Service should be more systematic,Anirban S,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,17-Jan-17,"The Makruzz boat itself is pretty good, well maintained, clean, with comfortable seating arrangements. The glass window panes are tainted. The interior is fully air-conditioned. There are a couple of washrooms at the back, which are kept clean. There is a snacks bar at the lower level too. 
The trips are of relatively short duration: 1-1.5 hours. There are a few TV screens inside which display the attractions in the islands along with commentary. When the journey starts from Port Blair, it's pretty exciting, which turns really bland soon enough, as there is literally nothing to see or do when the vessel is in the middle of the sea. 
The sore points are: 
1. the pick-up buses that carry people from outside the port to inside the dock at Port Blair are really small and inadequate. Just imagine the scene when so many people with lots of luggage try to board such a tiny bus. 
2. the jetties at the Havelock and the Neil islands are too small and narrow. They become very crowded when people start to get down from the vessel because so many people are already waiting there to board the ship for the return journey. Handing over your luggage at the cargo or collecting it may become a pain in all this chaos. 
3. plan well ahead and book online directly or through agents. Tickets are in high demand because this is the best cruise available. More",Mar-16

Professional,Raja S,"Chennai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,15-Jan-17,We used Markuzz for travelling in between port Blair and other islands. The crew is professional. One instance there where 2 ships at the port with both of them having the same label on one side so make sure before loading your luggage. The luggage are stacked and don't leave anything fragile inside. The ride depends on the sea conditions. They hand over the vomit bags and if you are prone do keep them in handy. They have a small cafeteria inside which serve snacks with hit and cold drinks. Our rides were very pleasant as the sea was in its best behaviour.,Jan-17
Majestic,Akash R,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,15-Jan-17,Makruzz is one of the best cruises available at Port Blair... Very clean and well maintained.. Has a small canteen kinda thing where you cn buy food and water and a large TV to keep you entertained,Jan-17
"Roaches, dirt and a good crew",Vijay R,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,14-Jan-17,"Shuttling between islands on Makruzz by opinion of their servies went steadily downhill. First trip was good. Well, I slept most of the time so I didn't use any of the facilities. The fact that we cannot use the deck was my only grouse. Next trip, the ferry was delayed. The crew were helpful and considerate and we reached the destination with only a 15 mins delay. Third one was a disaster. The coffee, which you have to get from the deck below, has floating bits of something (I am not taking a guess as to what it was). The crew offered another but I declined. The restroom was roach infested and my seat dirty enough to leave stains. More",Nov-16

Perfectly Safe. Nice/ clean interiors. We got deluxe seats ( less crowded, on 1st floor). You can even try for Royal Seats @60% additional cost.

Not so pleasant,Dushi247,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,06-Jan-17,"Crowded! The bathrooms are super dirty. It's shocking because the tickets are not very cheap so the least they can do is clean the bathrooms. There were some cockroaches so it's a good idea not to eat anything from the cafe on-board. Somehow, the ride from Port Blair to Havelock was the best and from thereon, everything went downhill. The sad part is that this is apparently one of the better options to get around in the Andamans. Hopefully, it will get better in the future.",Dec-16

If coming from abroad (especially in high season) they are the only ones taking advance online bookings I am aware of. 

If booking online and you experience 'hanging', try shortening your address. This appears to be a bug in the system and has caught me out more than once.

Good experience.,Sanjay D,"Navi Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,04-Jan-17,Good experience of short distance sea travel. Cleanliness is major issue. For snacks and drinks upper deck passenger has to go to lower deck even though paying more than lower deck passenger.,Dec-16
Illogical,Andydey,"Puri, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,03-Jan-17,"Good fleet but horrible attitude of people. We were a group of 7 people and surprisingly though booked together, our seats were allocated in different places. The man serving in the refreshment counter had horrible attitude. Was quite an uncouth fellow. The worst part is that the luggage tagging is not there. So u have to trust them and leave your luggage with a prayer on your lips that you get it back at he destination. Anyone can pick up a luggage and start walking so you have to be extremely vigilant and that can be challenging. So overall, not so pleasant experience.",Jan-17

Its a real smoothey which simply glides on the water. It has a very attractive appeal and highly comfortable seating. 

We were also completely impressed by the machine and the sailing team by the way they handled the first cruise to Havelock after the Cyclone Vardah. It was one hell of a ride. The waves were big and windy, but the confidence in the voice of the Captain when he told that the conditions are bad to worse but sailable made things inside the cabin little easy.

Best way to sail .,Jetsroy,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Dec-16,"On 13th Dec , we headed to Jahajrani Jetty to board Makruzz for our journey to Havelock . We walked in , submitted our luggage to the security counter , got our ticket's checked and all done within 10 minutes :) Makruzz crew welcomes you with grace and also guides you to your seat . We booked deluxe seats located at upper deck (1400 per person) . The upper deck is less crowded has good air conditioning and the passengers of upper deck are served complementary meals too. However one can also have other snacks on paid basis .The complementary meal box has a (mushroom roll with potato filling (Yummy ), a Veg sandwich , Lays packet and a Mango juice ) what else you need during a 1.5 hour journey . 

Pros : Upper deck is a boon for people prone to sea sickness . Also the very very less engine vibration .

The ferry is really clean and has 2 decks (both closed). Window glasses is all you have to look out to see the water and islands that you pass through. The leg space is fine. They also give free onboard meal based on the type of ticket bought (the food however is not that great). But they have set up a small shop inside which offers a lot of options to choose from (snacks only).

Incorrect information to make money,Vijay_Leo,"Navi Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,13-Dec-16,"On 10.12.2016, we had booked for 8am ferry from Port Blair to Havelock with return on the same day for 3.45pm ferry from Havelock to Port Blair. 
At 6.30am on the same day, we were told that the ferry would leave at 11am which would let us have about three hours at Havelock. However, once we boarded the ferry, we were told that the return timing has been preponed to 3pm, for which we would need to report at 2pm. The ferry reached Havelock only at 1pm which gave us only one hour at Havelock. 
This was not fair on part of Makruzz to keep tourists ill advised and ending up paying a huge sum to spend one hour at Havelock. 
The staff is extremely helpful. Kudos to all the members who were on the ferry. On our way back, the sea had got rough, however, the staff took great care of each and everyone. Compliments to them. 
The catamaran is very comfortable with good seats. Only one suggestion, the window panes should be cleaned regularly so that the tourists get a good view of the sea. More",Dec-16
A Fun and Quic Way to Reach Destination,501varunr,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,12-Dec-16,"I used Makruzz from Port Blair to Havlock Island, and then back to Port blair.

OVERALL RIDE & TIMINGS: a) This being a speed boat/ferry, that covers the distance between port blair and havlock in 1.5 hours, compared to other ferrys that cover the same distance in close to 2-2.5 hours, the ride gets a bit bumpy and i did see a number travellers getting sea-sick (vomitting).

c) Don't expect to walk to around the dock area, cause this ferry unlike the other regular ferrys, does not have an open dock freely accessible for the tourists/commuters. 
d) What i noticed and was told by my travel guide, is that this ferry is among the fastest in its services of embarking/ disembarking tourists compared to other ferrys. I obviously didn't travel in any other ferry so can't vouch for that. However, the services of this ferry (at a stand alone level) waere eally commendable 

2. SEATING & CLEANINESS: The seating area is clean and feels like you are sitting in a Spice-jet aircraft (in terms of leg room and shoulder room), i.e. it is Ok-Ok types. 
The washrooms definitely needs improvement. They are not at all clean, and stink like anything 

3. AIR CONDITIONING: The A.C. is a bit on the higher side, so i would recommend you carrying an extra jacket in your hand-baggage, since you would be asked to check-in your bigger suitcases before boarding the ferry 

3. FOOD SERVICE ON BOARD: Makruzz has an onboard fooding option. They serve chips, veg/non-veg rolls, tea, chocloates, juices, etc. Thats quite an exhaustive menu, if you like to munch during your travel 

4. STAFF AND SERVICE: The ferry's staff is very courteous and responsive. You can always find someone to take care of your queries and requests 

5. AESTHETICS: On the first look this does look like a premium high-end ferry, good for clicking some pictures furing boarding-deboarding the ferry. But then again, i feel its the interiors that matters the most to us, as travellers. 

Overall, i would definitely recommend this ferry.

No announcements were made nor there were enough chairs in the waiting hall for passengers and queries were also not answered properly... 

Finally when the craft arrived, they were swift to disembark the arriving passengers and take on board the departing passengers...

Best cruise for inter island transfers,Honesty988,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,27-Oct-16,"This is the best cruise for inter island transfers (PB-Havelock-Neil). I and my family tried almost all the classes and Economy is as good as any other class on this ship. Unlike other ferries (Green Cruise), the seats are very spacious and there is a good view from the windows (Green Ocean was like a jail, with the economy cabin having no windows and making us feel like we were goods). Makruzz does not allow you to venture out on deck unlike other ferries, but then, you do not need to, as window seats provide awesome views. The tickets are difficult to get, so best to book way in advance. The strange thing though, is half the ferry seats are empty, though you may be told that the ferry is entirely booked. So you could give luck a try and book directly at the counter at the port, if you have a flexible itinerary. More",Oct-16

Things may improve of they have some competition. 

The waiting Hall in Port Blair was heavily crossed when we reached there with no place to stand and on to of it it was hit and humid. During the return journey there was no check in process and we had to carry our luggage to the boat. 

The boat is fastest there and I can safely assume that it is most comfortable too but they must ensure smoother booking experience and better boarding system to make it a memorable journey. More",Oct-16

The return journey is around 3.30 PM. One had to report one hour before the departure of Cruise. The journey was comfortable. It is totally AC and has a good capacity of 280 passengers around. The first thing I noticed was that the fare is on very high side. For one and half hour journey cost you Rs.1000/- one sided therefore you will have to shell out for return journey Rs.2000/- which is not reasonable. The Markuzz Cruise was imported from Singapore and run by M/S Make Logistics private limited. In Boat there is also arrangements for snacks and tea, coffee etc. but the service is paid. The negative side of this Cruise is that you cannot go on deck to view or shoot sceneric view of sea. The entry is restricted whereas one another company in Port Blair is also offering services in which you can go to deck and enjoy the journey as per your interest.

Though I enjoyed my Onward journey very much , Return by Makruzz was disappointing . Here is my observation points 

1) Price was very high , 3 times higher 

2) Though the standard of the ship was very good but the entire journey was uncomfortable . I have never vommitted in travel journeys but when I travelled in this ship , It was very uncomfortable . Luckily I did not vomit as I was given seat in the upper Deck 

25--30 People travelling in the lower deck vommitted . Somehow there was some uncomfortableness in this ship

Good cruise for travelling to Havelock,Nainjot,"Noida, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,17-Aug-16,"We opted for Makruzz for travelling to Havelock from Port Blair. As travelling in peak season, we booked are tickets in advance and it helped a lot. Our ticket didn't include breakfast but you can purchase the same over the counter. Our journey from PortBlair to Havelock was really wonderful and comfortable. As a precaution, one must carry a medicine in case they feel sea-sickness. 

While travelling back, there was a warning of cyclone to which I must say Captain of the cruise responded well and didn't started even after people putting lots of pressure. He started only after it was advisable to travel and they made us reach Port Blair safely. During the whole journey, the complete crew was on their toes; they were really kind and helpful in answering to the needs of the passengers during a patch of rough sea. More",Sep-15

Good cruise to visit Havelock Island,Lavaleen,"Seattle, Washington",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,11-Aug-16,Makruzz provides cruise/ferry from Port Blair to Havelock. We had gone in off season so there not many people on the cruise but during peak seasons it is advidsable to pre book your tickets on the ferry. Depending on the ticket you purchase you are offered breakfast on the cruise. I think mine was premium seating. The staff is good. overall a good cruise to visit Havelock,Jul-16
Fast but not Enjoyable,flyingAviator,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,09-Aug-16,"Yes it is fast , Seating is very good , snacks shop is there. 
Tickets are higher then govt. ferry.

Food is served inside for Deluxe & Royal categories. Its just light tiffin type. There is also a snacks bar in the ground floor serving tea and snacks at reasonable rates.

It was real fun and I enjoyed every bit of it. Everyone need to make sure to book tickets properly as there were people struggling to keep their group members together as they booked tickets separately. Evening rides are thrilling due to high waves. So, if you are with elderly persons, kids and people with disabilities. book back seats as the ship often jumps over due to high tides. I was at the first seat and really enjoyed the bumps. Overall Great time!",Jul-16

Onward journey from PB to Havelock.- Smooth. but Cruise people were little harsh on tourists with all the straight faces, dont move, dont touch, dont sit, dont stand etc etc..fed up. And the cooling paper covered windows block all the much craved sea view. It is only as good as travelling in AC car. Didnt like even a bit as whats the point in travelling in Cruise with all these restrictions 2. Return Journey on 2nd July-> one hell of a terrific journey due to rough sea. And the crew members were so kind on the people. They were very helpful in moving the people to the back of the cruise, give vomiting covers, water etc. Glad this time we had good crew members. But after few rounds of vomiting, when i was getting to throw out again, all the good crew were missing and one junk head was just staring at me, When i asked him for little water, he was like , pay the money and get the bottle.

But once on board everything was fine , we had the front seats on the upper deck. Ride was smooth and easy the restrooms were small but clean and the cruise was well maintained . We opted for the food box but it was not good , just a juice and a crappy cake with some snack worth 5 bucks, don't opt for this . instead buy snacks frm port blair before u board and enjoy them on board.

I was impressed by the professionalism of the staff and the general cleanliness and maintenance of the service. Timings were maintained in both the sector which is big thing involving sea travel and here Makruzz gets full marks. The webportal is user-friendly and is very convenient to get the schedules, book tickets, etc. and is a big advantage for someone planning their travel in Andaman in advance. 
Traveled in the lower deck and the journey was very smooth one way and very rough on the return. The staff know their jobs and managed the turbulent sea and the related sea sickness issue of majority of the passengers quite well. General concern for safety was quite high. 
There is a nice snack bar and they serve good puffs, coffee, etc. Good option for the transfer to Havelock. Can highly recommend for the service and punctuality More",Jun-16

On 25th I reached Port Blair and on 26th my Port Blair to Neil journey was planned by my tour assistance Experience Andaman. We started from Port Blair and Makcruzz was supposed to reach Neil via Havelock. As we started our journey from Havelock, atmosphere changed suddenly and sea became highly rough. Vessel was getting such jerks that almost 30% of passengers vomited. Caption though took vehicle up to Neil but looking to 3 meter high tides, port security denied lending and we had to return to Port Blair. Though Makcruzz provided full journey (in fact double), they returned full booking amount as vessel could not lend. Staff was courteous and it was a thrilling experience as for the very first time I knew how it feels if you are passing by sea when its in rough condition. I suggest to buy Royal Class tickets rather premium that have tinted glasses which hampers outer view.

They do provide light snacks and drinks as complimentary package. To reach Makruzz check - in counter , you can a walk one Km distance or use the Makruzz bus shuttle. My suggestion is to walk the distance as it will give a glimpse of different ships and ferry docked and you can click pics. As you reach the Check - in counter, you deposit your baggage, if any and proceed to counter, where they verify your ticket, which is all easy process.

Cons: 
* Premium class passengers just cant stop peeking through the slide door to have a look of the Royal class cabin and in doing so, they keep opening and shutting the doors, which is highly irritating and in few cases, they just rush to the other door, which leads out. The door is locked and is only for crew but fellow passengers would try and open it and thereby disturb the peace in royal cabin. More",Apr-16

You must book in advance among a choice of 3 classes. For a relaxed experience opt for the Delux class or the more private Premium class. The ferry is very particular in keeping to its time - so make sure you aren't late. Hygiene-wise the ferry is clean enough but could be better (you do see the odd insects at times). Also their baggage handling of your luggage is a bit rough - so don't check-in anything you don't want broken. The journey is quite smooth and well settled.

Govt ferry allows you to go onto the deck and enjoy the ocean. It takes around 2 .5 hours for the port blair to havelock distance and charges rs 400 per person . If you don't want to get out in the sun, the seating space has air conditioning. The only problem with the govt ferry is that the tickets are really hard to get as they get opened to public 7 days in advance. Hotel touts usually flood the ticket booking office and make advance purchase for the paying customers and charge hefty premium. There is a big need for the online booking system to bring in transparency and ease. On the other hand, getting tickets for makruzz is a breeze and there is no need for advance booking, unless there is zero flexibility in your schedule. The tickets are prices at Rs 950(Deluxe), 1150(Premium) and 1600(Royal). We took the Rs 1600 tickets as others were not available for the date when we needed to travel. This ticket was like the business class of a airline, with crappy snacks and coffee served complimentary. The ride takes around 1.5 hrs and is quite uneventful since people are enclosed in box with no option to walk outside on the deck. More",Mar-16

"Terrible service, average boat ride",georg31415,"Mannheim, Germany",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,04-Apr-16,"Email contact beforehand was quick and clear, we blocked two return tickets with their office and agreed on picking them up after arrival in Port Blair. However, in the office we were told that they already sold our blocked tickets and the respective ferry service was sold out... but they could offer us the later service for going to Havelock, and one day earlier from leaving Havelock. Ridiculous when you already booked your hotel in HV. Additionally, the office lady did not think of offering us the service back via Neill (HV to Neill to PB instead of directly HV to PB), which turned out to be the very same boat and wasn't fully booked! One has just to buy two tickets (HV-NE & NE-PB, 600 INR more) to get on the ""fully booked boat"". Great, that the customer has to find that out and propose it, not the office person who screwed up the reservation & blockage. 
Anyways, our rickshaw driver organized afterwards some Governmental ferry ticket (which was old, but safe & punctual & cheap) and we went to HV on time. 
ONE MORE TIP FOR OTHER TRAVELLERS: check for the Helicopter service from PB to HV. It's subsidized and ridiculously cheap (1500 INR single) for a scenic 15 min flight, as I learned by chance on the way back from PB. More",Mar-16

The royal class has 8 seats in pair of 2 facing each other. Drinks and food are complimentery.

Inside the cruise ship, there's a eatery selling out eatables, cold drinks, chocolates and coffee. The sail took around 2 hours and the only complaint we had throughout was the tinted glasses used on the cruise. They kind of blocked the beautiful view from the windows. The staff was cordial and assisted in all ways possible. What I won't forget from this sail is at one point, all that a person can see around is beautiful blue water with no sight of land!

The journey was very comfortable, but their handling of the luggage at the end of journey is pathetic , make sure you mark your luggage very prominently, may be by a red ribbon or whitener, other wise with so many similar bags ,someone else may land up picking your baggage.Except for this I have to give them full marks for their services.

Smooth sail,Jktra,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,20-Mar-16,"We travelled to and fro to Havelock from Port Blair on Makruzz. The boarding pass was issued promptly and the operators were very punctual in departure and arrival. 

Taking advise of the various reviews of tripadvisors, we chose to carry one handbag each for the 2 days trip. Hence we were spared the checkin and checkout of baggage. It was good advise given by the reviewers and I suggest that all the big bags be kept at the port blair hotel only and only a small overnight bag be carried on Makruzz. 

We had done online booking and the process was smooth. The deluxe seats which we booked had a complimentary meal of a muffin, fruit juice and a sandwich. While going to havelock, the sandwich had some filling inside but while returning all we got was a loaf of bread. Probably someone forgot to make the sandwich. 

The only difference between deluxe and ordinary class is that the number of seats on the below deck are more and hence there is more movement and noise while deluxe is quiet comparatively. 

Overall we had a good sail. The sea was calm and we reached our destination on time and safely. More",Mar-16

I enjoyed the sun set from the vessel. After sun set weather became rough. Vessel started rolling, lot of passengers had nausea and vomiting, which was taken care of by Mak attendants.

Good ride to Havelock,Pathik_2404,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,15-Mar-16,"Makruzz is one of the private ferries operating between Port Blair and Havelock. They have ferries to other destinations like Neil Island as well. It is a good way to cover the 2-2.5 hour distance to the Havelock Islands. The vessels are modern and the entire experience of boarding is similar to an airline boarding without the security check- right from baggage check in to the safety procedures video. The boarding point is about a kilometer away from the road where the auto rickshaw would drop you. You can choose to either walk the distance or catch a bus which ferries passengers to the terminal. 

The ship is clean and well maintained and they show informative documentaries about the Andamans en route which are fairly engaging. 

Makruzz doesn't allow passengers to get onto the outer deck but you can move around inside. There is also a cafeteria on board that allows you to get some nibbles as you cruise towards the beautiful Havelock Islands. 

You can book tickets online and ticket prices are around 950 per person upwards depending on the class of seating you opt for. More",Mar-16

One must realize that it is impossible to by tickets at the dock, but only for the government fairy. I tried bet my western nerves were racked after about an hour in a que that never moves.

A neccessary evil - if visiting Havelock Islands,Sachin P,"Bangalore, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,08-Mar-16,"The title may sound a bit misleading or frightening but a cruise over the seas is more of a requirement to see the Havelock Island. The other option is to skip visiting the island. For an average tourist who is budget conscious the other options of using a sea-plane or a helicopter is much more expensive and requires higher level of planning. That being said Makruzz offers the best possible cruise between Port Blair and Havelock Island. This ""catamaran"" has a fully covered passenger area, with good and comfortable chairs. The seating area is air-conditioned and windows with thick sun-films ensure that the heat and glare does not hit the passenger. No passenger is allowed on any decks out side the enclosed area and the crew are very strict about it. But this does lead to situations were groups of tourist just stand right next to the windows facing the front of the ship looking at the sea. The seats are well numbered and the crew ensures that the passengers first sit according to the seat numbers printed on the tickets. Please note that the seat numbers are allocated right at the time of making the booking (and NOT when issuing the boarding pass). Seats with Alphabets A & N would be the window seats. Makruzz also has a cafetaria at the lower desk (the Premium passenger area), selling snacks, cold drinks and a few curios. Alchohol is not served...

Makruzz also has a good demonstration on the safety aspects; including the availability and use of life jackets etc. 

The tough part of the cruise starts after around 15 mins of sailing, when I feel the catamaran actually enters the rough sea. There is a fare share of bobbling as the sea is rough and the catamaran has picked up speed. For people who are not used to travel by ship this is going to be an unpleasent experience. During my onward journey our two year old daughter vomitted, and was in a foul mood for quite some time. It was also an experience to carry the crying kid, on a fast sailing vessel, across the deck to the ""aft"" (back) area where lies the toilets. The catamaran has 3-4 toilets including one for handicapped passengers. Soon we found out that there was a big gathering around the toilet area, as sea-sickness effects even older people. 

Makruzz does provide the maximum care considering the natural problems related to sea travel. Vomitting bags are kept near every seat, and the crew also carry additional stock. The cruise from Port Blair to Havelock Island took around 1.5 to 2 hours of sea travel. We did expect a similar experience during the return journey, but by then perhaps the sea was all calm and quiet. It was a very uneventful journey. More",Mar-16

Though we were initially adamant on travelling to Havelock islands both ways in a Makruzz, our operator booked only the return tickets from Havelock to portblair in a Makruzz.. Initially disappointed we started our onward journey to Havelock in a cruise called Ocean Green as I recall.. The major advantage was we could stand all the way in the deck and enjoy the cruise cruising through the blue seas and grooving to the music being played in the background..Makruzz as we started will not allow you to loiter around. The major advantage though was it will make the journey in half the time then an Ocean Green..

1. You cover distance in only 1.5 hrs from PB to Havelock while Govt ferry takes about 3 hrs 
2. Fully air conditioned, so best option if you are travelling in summer 
3. Online booking can be done on their site 
4. You can buy snacks from their snacks counter on ship 

Negatives 
1. You can not go outside their Cabin area 
2. As its made of fiber, its light weight. So with string wind, it sways and people starts puking. In my journey, around 70% people got sea sickness 
3. You can not get outside fresh air and enjoy sea 
4. The worst part of it is even though they have big glass panel windows, all have tinted glass except Royal class. Only Royal class (total 8 seats) have transparent glass windows. So you can not enjoy view if you book tickets for Premium or Deluxe class More",Feb-16

Good Boat to Travel to Havelock.,Vivek S,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,15-Feb-16,This is a big Boat which can accommodate a lot of people in its two Decks. It is a steady yet fast boat to ride on. One must use this boat to go to Havelock if you plan to comeback to Portblair the same day from Havelock. It saves you a lot of time.,Aug-15
So much better than the Govt. ships,Natasha D,"Thane, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,14-Feb-16,"It had an aeroplane kind of seating and service. I have sea sickness but the steadiness of the boat , made my journey in water very convenient. Though if you have luggage bag pl make sure u r in time to collect it before sumone misunderstands and takes your luggage bag instead. Ya! That happened so pl make sure you take ur luggage only. But the makruzz officials worked on it and helped us get it luggage bag back in time. Though this boat is expensive, do insist on this service as the govt ships will lower your package price but hygiene factors are not taken care of in Govt. Ships. More",Feb-16

We got ours via Munjoh, a resort in Havelock Island where we stayed in and is one of the hotels supported by Makruzz. Journeys at sea do not get any better than this, especially within a short amount of time. Very ideal when it comes to time constraints. More",Jan-16

We tried for a few months to book a ferry to Neil but it can't seem to happen for all sorts of reasons. We get to Port Blair. Yes we have tickets for tomorrow, come to our office right away. We come to the office. No tickets until next week. But there are tickets to Havelock. After a lot of back and forth and getting quite upset that we are told many different things via email, phone and in person, suddenly and magically we get a ticket for 2 days later. 
Looking back we could have easily taken the government ferry for A LOT cheaper!

Book for premium class if you want to take pics during journey; those are the seats on both sides of ship from where you get good view of sea. However unlike Hong Kong you are not allowed to go on deck for safety reasons. While returning from Havlock the ship stops at Neil Island where 80% of passenger went off the ship to go to Neil island and new passenger boarded from Neil; however since we didn't book for Neil we felt very sad and nostalgic on the way back from Havlock to Port Blair.

One of the few nice ways to travel between Havelock & Port Blair - Book Early !!!,Dhiman_HD,"Hong Kong, China",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,25-Jan-16,"This is one of the few ways top traverse between Havelock & Posrt Blair (others being Government Ferry and one competitor of Makruzz, another private cruise service called Green Ocean). 

Quick Pointers: 
1. Please read the title again and book really early - at least 2 months in advance. Tickets will fly off like irctc and there is no tatkaal option here ;) 
2. Runs two times a day (up and down) morning & afternoon. 
3. Has an optional route via Neil island a swell - in case that is on your itinerary. 
4. Problem with Green Ocean is that it does NOT have a return for Havelock to Port Blair in morning. So if you miss morning Makruzz then you cannot do anything on that day in Port blair as well (avoid government ferries for obvious reasons) 
5. Food served on Makruzz is not good (one that come along with ticket)

If you are not a sea person, makes sense to have a anti-vomiting pill before hand.

There are different classes in the ship (probably four) as we have in trains and flights. I have purchased for the 2nd best class. 
Since this is a fibre boat it was winding along with the waves which you will not experience in Govt. Ships. 
Needless to say, that it has furnished with AC and also provided with good quality food. 
As I was travelling in evening, I have been served with Sandwich, Samosa, Mango drink and a sweet. 
The only problem is with the frequent windings of the ship you will feel vomiting tendency and most of the passengers even vomits. However the service boys and ladies were always ready to help with the small paper bags. Even the bags are present in the front of the seats.

Best Option to Travel to Havelock,Swati P,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,09-Jan-16,"Very comfortable and fully air conditioned and fastest ferry. Port Blair to Havelock is 1.5 hours and vice versa. On time. The best part is that it is easy to book ticket in it compare to other ferry. You are totally dependent on travel agents to book on other ferry. While you can book ticket through website or by calling them. The worst part was that I wanted to book ticket for 15-Dec. In Sep, they told me that booking will open on 15-Oct. In Oct, they told me it will open on 30-Oct then 7-Nov, then 15-Nov. Finally it open on 17-Nov but there was problem with their website. I called them and they booked the ticket for me. One precaution...eat atleast 2 hours before the ferry otherwise there Is chance of vomiting. Also, there is shop in ferry but others things are on MRP but kinderjoy and jams are double the MRP. More",Dec-15
Frustratingly bad ticketing process,Rob373,"Northampton, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,09-Jan-16,"We tried to book tickets for the Port Blair to Havelock service via the website. I filled in all the details such as class, date, number of seats etc... instead of a reservation or confirmation of availability, I got an email with another application form requesting all of the same details again. We called the company repeatedly (from within India using Indian phone lines) and kept getting cut off - couldn't get anywhere with the company at all and had to get our hotel to arrange the tickets. The morning crossing is timed so that it leaves 45 minutes after the regular flights arrive, so if you want to travel straight to Havelock you have to wait around until the afternoon. On the boat the windows are dark tinted so you can't enjoy the views and the aircon is turned up so high my partner was borrowing clothe out of my bag to use as blankets. The service is punctual and quick, it is everything else that is frustrating and poorly thought out. More",Dec-15
beware- Vomiting precautions needed.,plumpoo,"Amritsar, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,08-Jan-16,"Classy , fast but take loads of toffees with you and don't eat just before the trip as it may lead to vomiting. Many will accompany u inside for vomiting so don't worry though . hehehe..

The air conditioning inside is much needed with the local climate, especially for the backpacker that's worn out from carrying luggage around in the tropical heat

Neil to Port Blair in a jiffy!,Anweshachatterjee,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,15-Dec-15,"I travelled in the Premium class from Neil island to Port Blair. The trip took approximately 1 hour 20 minutes. The Premium class tickets cost Rs 800. Premium class availability is more and Deluxe class is sold out first and the tickets cost Rs 950. Both these prices are from December, 2015. 

The service of the on board staff was really good and there is a sort of cafe catering to your hunger pangs. But be prepared to pay more. A juice that costs Rs 30 was for Rs 60 on board. The coffee was Rs 30 per cup and was overly sweet. 

You could hardly feel the sea rolling underneath the vessel and I would recommend this for any person prone to seasickness. I have been told this service is available from Port Blair - Havelock Island - Neil Island - Port Blair. One can book tickets online which is of course a bliss! More",Dec-15

I also traveled in Green Ocean which I found better then Makruzz as Green Ocean has open deck to take a walk n chill. Green Ocean also has three classes and here royal has 40 odd seats and top level. Same as Makruzz Green Ocean also has a cafeteria which serves basic eatables

But, being a bag-packer and adventurist this ic s not a good option because it doesn't allow you to feel the sea breeze, the saltiness and the feel of a real sea voyage, in short you don't have an open deck to feel all this. Moreover when the sea is rough this is not a comfortable ride. Being a catarman model it is not so comfortable on rough sea. 

Rest this is the best cruise in Andaman by so far...!!! More",Aug-15

Inside of ship was neat and clean. Seats were comfortable. It is managed very professionally just like as in case of aircraft. Boarding process was smooth and journey was pleasant with view of sea. At the same time safety standards followed on the ship are of international level which is really impressive. 
However there is no facility to go on the roof or on open dock area. It would have been great if there was a chance to enjoy journey on the open dock of ship.",Dec-14

Comfortable trip from Port Blair to Havelock,kazmnblr,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,24-Oct-15,"Probably the most comfortable way of getting to and back from Havelock. Has over 280 seats and yet is fully booked in peak season. 

We booked online at their website well in advance. I would recommend booking in Premium (ie economy), rather than in Delux / Royal (upper deck) which have no incremental amenities abut cost significantly more. 

Worth checking in 45 minutes ahead of departure as the boarding is slightly chaotic. Collecting baggage on disembarking is even more chaotic. Also worth checking on the timing a day before the journey as the schedule shifts around (they called to inform but connectivity on Havelock is very poor). 

At Havelock, most resorts have a 9am checkout so preferable to take the morning Makruzz back to Port Blair (we were not aware as the website had directed us by default to the afternoon departure). Given that in peak season, the resorts dont offer late check-out, its better to head back rather than hanging out without a hotel room. More",Oct-15

Cruise Travel to Havelock Island on board MV Makruzz,SundarRam54,"Hyderabad, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,30-Aug-15,"I traveled by Makruzz on royal class. This class consists of just about 10 seats in a cabin at the rear of MV Makruzz. The seats are suitable for couples who need privacy. Otherwise the view from this class is limited.

The deluxe class is on first floor together with Royal class. There is nothing special about this class but you have to pay extra money in comparison to Premium class.

Voyage of Comfort and Luxury!,premartha,"London, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,01-Jul-15,"No doubt this Catamaran is a combo of comfort and luxury, cruising through the beautiful sea of A & N. One can board it from Phoenix Bay Jetty at Port Blair to visit Havelock and/ or Neil Islands. Makruzz have seating on two decks with upper deck seats costing more. Views from Makruzz's upper deck are not good as life-rafts kept along the windows cause obstruction and also you feel like just sitting in a restaurant, I would suggest book in the lower deck. Lower deck is cheaper, its more lively and spacious because of capacity or number of seats to accommodate more people, moreover it has a better view from all the directions. The seats were very comfortable, air-conditioning was good, there is a snacks counter which serves tea/ coffee n most of the commonly consumed snacks. Best thing about Makruzz is its online reservation system where you can choose your seats as per your preference, make the payment online and get an instant confirmation of your booking, you don't need to wait or depend on brokers paying them an extra fee/ commission. I have seen this with Coastal Cruise in particular where you have to call their office to get a tentative booking and they will always force you to book a higher category seats saying lower is not available as they know higher categories get booked or filled at last only.

On negative side its quite costly compared to government ferry but its really difficult to get the seats in government one but the kind of luxury you are getting on this cost in Makruzz is worth paying for in particular if your are traveling with your family. Crew were very attentive and took good care of people. There are toilets at the rear. There was an LCD mounted in front playing songs continuously and a documentary showcasing various Islands in A&N group and their specialties. The check-in process at Port Blair was smooth and pretty much like as at an Airport, make sure to carry your Ids. I suggest keep some digestives in case you feel vomit while cruising through rough sea or climate. Another tip, if you are traveling from Havelock to Neil and Neil to Port Blair the same day just inquire if they can leave your luggage in the cruise itself rather than you carrying it while you roam in Neil Island and collect it later when you get down at Port Blair. Coastal cruise offers such service not sure about Makruzz.

There is also a small Canteen in the ship and hospitality is commendable. They also play hit Hindi movie songs inside the ship which is also very entertaining. There is no negative about this Ship and all our family members enjoyed the ride very much. 

One positive i want to share: On returning from Havelock to Port Blair, due to rough sea, there are some jerks and oscillation due to which some passengers started vomiting but crew members had taken proper care of those passengers and took them to the rear seats where jerks are less.

On our way back we had a turbulent sea & hence lot of guests went through sea sickness. Barring that the entire experience, right from check-in to check out feels premium.

Boat OK but the rest is not great,metrobird,"Protaras, Cyprus",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,30-Apr-15,"You can book online! But when you arrive at the port there are no signs so you have no idea where to go. Basically, walk straight forward as far as you can go and the Makruzz tin hanger is on the left. If you're early the gates will still be closed. 

Beware if you're a foreigner - you will be targeted by people pretending to work for Makruzz (turns out they don't) who insist on showing you the way, carrying your bags, etc. and then they demand payment. 

The actual ferry itself is pretty good. It's a pity they don't vary the times a little (all the ferries sail at pretty much the same time as each other). 

Make sure you book your return journey from Havelock in good time. As the internet and mobile phone service is so bad on the island you will probably have to go to the port to book your return ticket, so my advice is to do it as soon as you arrive. 

When you do get back to Port Blair (again, if you're a foreigner) you will be mobbed by a gang of baying tuk tuk drivers. I mean they really will set on you! At first I actually thought they were going to attack us. All very bizarre. More",Feb-15

On the way back, at havelock, a tiny room to check in, then we had to grab chairs as and when the get empty and sit outside in the hot sun. This was terrible ! Then no tagging of the luggage, we had to drag it to the pier, stand in a very long queue in the hot sun while people boarded, and then handed over the luggage. We were drenched in sweat by the time we boarded. On arrival in port blair, ther were just 2 rickety old buses for a boat load of over 250 passengers.... Most of them walked, out, but my taxi was waiting where the bus was to drop us and due to shortage of bus, we walk with the rest of the crowd and had to ask the taxi to come to the other entrance. 

The ferry is Good and comfortable, but the whole checkin process, the horrible bus, the slow check in is terrible and needs to be improved on ! More",Apr-15

The vessel was large one with 12 abreast seating (3 seats times 4 columns) in each row. The staff was courteous. The view from the upper deck was certainly more superior. It has a ""business class"" type of seating with 8 seats.",Apr-15
Great experience,SubirBose,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,17-Apr-15,"They have three classes to travel between Port Blair - Havelock 

1. Premium – Rs.975/- each (without food) at lower deck 
2. Deluxe – Rs.1,150/- each (With food) at upper deck 
3. Royal – Rs.1,600/- each. (With food) at upper deck. 

I noticed there is hardly any difference between the Premium class and Deluxe. One can opt for either of the one without thinking twice. The food they provide can be tagged as “Meager”. 

However, their professionalism really deserves a bend over. Right outside the gate of the jetty, they keep their bus ready to help the passenger to check in. It takes 75 to 90 minutes to reach its destination. In our case, it took 90 minutes from Port Blair to Havelock and only 75 minutes to reach Port Blair from Havelock. Well decorated interior with well-mannered staff made our journey even better. 

Over all it was really a great experience. More",Apr-15

However, it feels like they don´t care anything about their customers. While at Havelock, we heard about others getting their ferry cancelled with less than 24 hours notice, and the same happend to us. Reason: Not enough passengers... Doesn´t seem to be a professionally run business. Would give Coastal Cruises a try next time",Apr-15

A free of cost bus / coach has been also deployed for commutation from Makruzz alighting point till the entrance of the jetty / harbor, which is a good initiative. She follows the policy of no smoking & non consumption of liquor on board. It is also good to notice that they are very punctual & strict towards entire boarding procedure. Please mandate to reach the boarding point in before the given prior departure time or you are not entertained without ticket even, this is what makes them truly corporate.

I could really appreciate it more because on the way to Havelock, we had taken the Govt Ferry. The Govt Ferry takes two and a half hours and the seating area is pathetically maintained with cockroaches all over the place. The Makruzz on the other hand is the experience of flying. Very well maintained. Clean seating areas. The sail is so smooth as well, can hardly feel the ferry rock, The speed they mentioned they were going at on out trip was 23 knots, and they did the Havelock - PB journey in just over an hour. They also have buses in the PB jetty and provide a drop till the main gate. At double the price of the Govt Ferry, I still feel it is a worthy upgrade. More",Mar-15

Luxury? Monopoly?,sanjay_ska,"Greater Noida, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,28-Mar-15,"I travelled between Port Blair and Havelock and back. I must say it was a comfortable ride. But I'd still like to talk of it some. 

Likes : air-conditioned catamaran with a host of people trying to run it professionally. The aircon worked well. The seating was neat and clean and spacious. The departure and arrival was punctual. 

What can be improved : The PA system can be improved. One cannot discern clearly announcements being made. Safety instruction cards were not placed for every seat. The onboard snack sale counter was extremely expensive with all items being sold far above the written price without a cash memo or invoice. Wonder why officials in the island government are looking the other way! At the Port Blair jetty, Makruzz had one single check in counter open which resulted in a lengthy queue. Baggage check in was in another single counter which meant a second lengthy queue. Check in at Havelock was no different. And there wasnt any arrangements for baggage check in at all. More",Mar-15
Better than the expectations,indian302,"Hyderabad, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,24-Mar-15,"A nice cruse, not much difference in lower and upper deck seating, except they serve snacks in the upper deck included in the ticket price. If you want to buy some thing for eating, be ready to shell out double the MRP, which is very unusual and Makruzz should not be doing it. This spoils their image. 

They should also have a better luggage management process. This creates a chaos for some time, while collecting the luggage at Havelock. 

They also stop at Neil Island, while coming back from Havelock to Port Blair. We were not aware about this.",Mar-15

Packed lunch was nice, I usually dont eat sandwiches but what I had was fresh and tasty. While travelling from Port Blair to Havelock we had a company of one cockroach on the wall but well behaved and didnt fall on top of our heads and disappeared somewhere after a short while so watch out, it could be behind you next time :-) When travelling in Royal cabin one could get a hope of having a priority check-in and being first to get out (like on a plane) but it wasnt the case, so boarding and leaving the last after the crowd was a good idea.

Wow... what a ride!!,SandeepJana,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,11-Feb-15,"We commuted to and from Port Blair to Havelock Island via the Makruzz cruise and indeed it was one of the most exciting water travel of my life. 
The speed with which it travels over the water was scintillating. Although we did get on to some turbulent water where we could experience some waves otherwise most of the time we could not feel if we were on water or land as the ride was so smooth. 

The seats and interiors were quite comfortable and they have a snacks bar too to munch things during the 90 minutes cruise.

Baggage woes,Rangeerit,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,14-Dec-14,"We were on the Makruzz ferry from Port. Blair to Havelock on Monday 8th December and from Havelock to Port Blair on Thursday December 11th 2014. While the baggage claim process at Port Blair was stressful, baggage handling was an issue on the ferry ride from Port Blair to Havelock. 

The sling of one of our pricey totes was sliced into two during our Port Blair to Havelock island ride. The sling was fine till the time that we checked in on the cruise. Obviously the piece had been mishandled. 

The baggage claim process at Port Blair was frustrating during our return ride. . It was absolutely chaotic. As several passengers were jostling to collect their baggage at the same time, everybody was falling over each other to pick up their baggage. 

I feel it is a negative moment of truth that Makruzz is creating by not paying attention to the baggage process. The process needs to be lot more reliable and peaceful in comparison with what it is currently. It is a turn off for passengers when their baggage gets damaged and collecting baggage becomes a challenging process at the end of a trip. More",Dec-14

However Makruzz Havelock office informed that we will loose cancellation charge even though they cancelled the morning trip and accommodated us in the evening trip.

Makruzz torture !!,Seepij,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,14-Nov-14,"Think twice before you travel by Makruzz between Andeman islands. 
The only advantages you get over the Government run ship are saving one hour slightly better Air Conditioning. 
You remain a prisoner in your seat during the journey with numerous restrictions. 

Irrespective of the class you travel, 30-40 minutes spent from check - in to boarding are torturous. Stand in que out in scorching sun with all your luggage (or shellout money and hire porters). No announcements, nobody from Makruzz to asist you. Face the Port security staff that will remind you of colonial kala pani police you might have visualised while watching light and sound program at cellular jail memorial . 
Your luggage remain on mercy of gods. No receipts. On disembarking, pick up one you like. 
The makruzz staff takes no responsibility for your luggage and is there to make sure you stick to the instructions dictated by them in the name of passenger's safety. 
On disembarking simply pick up your luggage and get lost as soon as possible. More",

Just over 90 minutes. Check in is airport style with queues after being picked up outside port by a Makruzz minibus. Bit chaotic but when you get on board very civilised. Comfortable spacious seats and gets you to havelock efficiently. You can't go outside but air on was good and sea flat when we travelled. On return to Port Blair we took government Ferry and difference was stark. Worth the extra cost.,Oct-14
Excellent cruise,bidyunk,"Toronto, Canada",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,30-Oct-14,"Makruzz is a great option for those who wish for a refined experience for their Havelock trip. The vessel is well maintained and has a total capacity of 250+ pax. 
There are three classes Premium, Deluxe and Royal. Deluxe and Royal are on the upper deck and Premium class is on the lower deck. The vessel is fast and covers the distance between Port Blair and Havelock in about 75-85 minutes which is way faster than the Government Ferries. 
However there is a cause of concern in case of turbulent or rough weather since Makruzz doesn't operate in such cases and you have to Govt ferry in such cases. Also they do not have a backup vessel in case this one has some issues. 
Situations might become tricky if the trip is cancelled suddenly. More",

Around this time of the season, Makruzz was the only option to book tickets online before starting our journey from Delhi and to avoid last minute queues to book tickets on Govt ferry only upon arrival at PB. The journey from PB to Havelock takes 90 minutes by Makruzz as against 150 minutes through Govt ferry. The seating and the air-conditioning is very good inside, long side screens makes the overall view very entertaining. Although priced much higher than Govt ferry, I still recommend all passengers to book online tickets in advance and choose window seats at the main lower deck only for a proper view.

You wont appreciate until you sail the govt ferry,amitku_in,"Noida, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,28-Apr-14,"I booked the tickets via paradiseandaman web site instead of direct makruzz website as it offered us rebate from Port blair to Havelock. 

We went deluxe as there was less crowd and more room for my children to roam and play. Royal is absolutely avoidable. Food comes with a premium so have some snacks. The trip is much faster than govt ferry. 

We also saw the cabin of the ship. The baggage was handled in the same manner as it is in airport with tagging and all, beware of porters if you cant drag your luggage to the counter (a 100m - could be difficult in scotching sun and multiple bags).

Unreliable and avoidable,JoyjeetM,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,21-Apr-14,"They just have one catamaran with which they run back to back trips from Port Blair to Havelock and back. The prices are pretty high as compared to the Government ferry and coastal cruise but services are really pathetic. I booked three deluxe tickets of Rs.950 each for Port Blair to Havelock and we were allotted seats on the upper deck. The problem was bad AC even after paying so much we almost had to travel standing right below the AC vent just to be comfortable. 
While returning the Makruzz did not come as it met some accident and they didn't have any alternate arrangements, we were stranded on the havelock island for another day without any help from the management providing any stay or any other facilities. We missed our flights the next morning and it was a lot of trouble. I really wanted to sue them but who has so much time. 
I would suggest to use the Government ferry which might not look as luxurious as makruzz but at least they have multiple options if one stops working. More",Jan-14
Unorganized in booking. Otherwise ok.,Voyager_Nineteen71,"Pune, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,12-Apr-14,"We had earlier decided to go to Havelock Island via Makruzz. On landing at Port Blair, we went to the Makruzz counter at the airport and took the tickets. We reached the bus which took us to the departure point wherein there was a huge rush of people trying to check in their luggage and collect boarding passes. This could have been made a little more organized. However, on landing at the 'departure' point, we found that the person at the airport had not intimated the staff, and so our 'boarding passes' were handwritten. We had earlier on requested for 4 seats together but we were given 2 seats in 1 row, one in another and the third elsewhere. On the way back to Port Blair via Neil Island boat, our luggage was not even tagged (unlike while going to Havelock) as a result of which there was a little fear that someone else could mistakenly go off with one's luggage. Also, we had to wait outside the Makruzz office in the heat for quite some time due to the limited number of chairs. The journey via the boat was ok per se both ways. It is a clean A/C boat. Do not, however, believe in much of the video of the Andamans. Many of the places are shut on account of the boat tragedy in Dec 2013. More",Mar-14

Faster way to commute between Havelock and PB,trotter_abhi,"Seattle, Washington",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,01-Feb-14,"Without any doubts, this is a comfortable and fast way to commute between Port Blair and Havelock. 

We rode the Makruzz while going to and from Havelock Island. Being a catamaran, the vessel is prone to winds and choppy waves, and can get pretty rough in such conditions. While going from Port Blair, we faced such conditions, and almost everyone onboard got seasick. Although, they are prepared for this, and give people sickness bags and manage it nicely. 

The seating is divided in three categories, Premium, Deluxe and Royal. The Premium seats on the lower deck, in my opinion are the best with great side and front views. Seating is comfortable in all the classes, and choosing the premium class might be the best deals. 

Booking for the makruzz can also be done online. They start accepting requests around one month in advance, and the email support is good. If you are planning your vacation on your own, it might be a good idea to book this online and be free from all worries. More",Jan-14

Good Experience,AnilAggarwal,"Kurukshetra, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,21-Jan-14,"fast way to Havelock by sea, nice cruise. Initially opted for royal seats but came to know that it is a small cabin of 8 seats with limited views. so dropped that & asked operator for deluxe seats 
Deluxe seats are on upper deck, no front view. Opinion is lower deck premium seats are better with front views also ,restaurant is also on lower deck 
comfortable seats, silent smooth cruise 
Makruzz travel is better than Coastal Cruise 
Check in,baggage handling both at Port Blair & Havelock is mismanaged 
On our travel day thier printer went out of order so no boarding passes,just stamping on tickets,similarly no check in baggage tags were issued 
Over all a good travel experience

Don't opt for Royal Class,iFlex,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,20-Jan-14,"We were couple with an infant and opted for Royal Class. A very small cabin with 8 seats, no good view and very bad! My wife and daughter were puking the whole day and I felt so bad that I booked in their royal class, a ticket that cost me Rs. 1400! PLEASE TRUST ME, don't ever opt for their Royal class. On return I opted for deluxe which is almost half the price and far better, with good views and larger hall. If you have lots of cash and just looking for a way to spend, opt for deluxe class and make paper planes with the rest of the cash and fly them to ocean! 

And as usual, ""coach"" service from Port Blair harbor entrance to the boarding area is pathetic too, around 100 people cramming into a mini bus (Swaraj Mazda) and no room for heavy luggage. On return we just walked, far better. 

Another catch, there is no ""check-in"" at havelock (that we discovered only during our disembarkation at havelock), so you would need to carry luggage by hand up to the ship. A long, long walk and if you are with heavy luggage, it would sure make you write a ""Terrible"" review here at trip adviser. And yes, you can't hire a taxi/auto, as these are not allowed in the port area, what a sick guys!

Nice and a different experience,sunnytafc,ludhiana,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Dec-13,"The ship is a cruise in name and worth. Buy the cheaper seats they are as good as the expensive ones. I have been to both Govt. ship and Makruzz. The Govt. ship is cheaper and good if you want to experience open sea air but Makruzz saves time , is comfortable and you don't get Sea lag. 
Go to the upper floor take a look in the Pilot's cabin .They allow it. In ship food is costly bring your own food.",May-13

Best way to travel Port Blair/Havelock,RaviDubai,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,30-Nov-13,"Makruzz may be more expensive than the normal government ferry; but considering you save 50% of the time (this takes an hour and a half only) you have that much more time to see the Andamans. It is extremely comfortable with large glass windows offering amazing views of the Islands and the Ocean. While getting off and boarding the Makruzz in Havelock is no big deal, the same cannot be said regarding Port Blair....the distance from the car park to the Makruzz is not walkable if you have luggage; while they have their buses, they could make some more effort in organising it a little better to avoid all the chaos, confusion and discomfort to passengers.

Andaman's Chariot!!!,Sunil H,"Yelagiri, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,12-Oct-13,"Simply the best!..You count in terms of hospitality, communication, service and maintenance..they are the best. After travelling in govt ferry and coastal cruise I felt Makruzz if the best option to travel Havelock from port blair and vice versa. The reasons are the way they handle their customers is similar to how an airline operates out airport. You will get free bus service from outside the jetty till ferry, very well managed luggage check in process, smooth boarding and better assistance in the ferry for all your queries. Though there are 3 different categories to book ticket its recommended to book in premium cat as it offers best view. In ferry they provide guidance on the places that ferry passes through...so you will get little glimpse of history about these places. The staff are really very well trained to match the industry standards, which is highly appreciated. This is the way to achieve better standards and high customer satisfaction. Cafeteria is quite good at premium cost. So it is advisable to carry some snacks if you want to have on the way..It took nearly 90 mins to reach Havelock. Baggage handling at the Havelock also is very good considering the facilities available at jetty. Overall its nice experience and looking forward to sail on the Chariot again!!! More",Sep-13

This is the fastest way on sea to travel to havelock (sea plane would be faster :). The hosts on board were good too. They have the option of luggage check in, which is a nice little touch. The only downside: there are only two fixed times of travel. If you plan to stay at Havelock then you will have to make some other arrangements for Havelock to Port Blair trip. However, the goverment run ships are also pretty nice if you book the highest priced tickets(~350 for a special cabin, which is still substantially lesser than Makruzz).",Nov-12

Painful,sbharti123,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,12-Apr-13,"I traveled with my infant daughter and after paying reasonably high fees, I was expecting a comfortable journey. From my hotel in port blair I booked a cab to the ferry. The cab dropped me on a roadside where buses from mazruzz would pick passengers and take them to the ferry. From that point the painful part starts. 1. The bus which they incidentally had just one is a mini-bus. A non-ac, though only to take passengers to a site 500 meters away. Why can't they have ac buses and may be more than one or a bigger one or cabs? I have no idea. 2. No proper arrangements were made to handle luggage in the bus. Instead local people acting like coolies were doing the job for a small tip. The bargaining part with these coolies is not what I can call anything like comfortable. 3. With more than 100 passengers to board the bus and with the bus capacity of less than 25, it meant people would force themselves in. Everyone desperate to get in to the bus. Inside the bus, the site was appalling, with newly married couples, old people, everyone just crushing against each other. Why no one from Makruzz was there to manage the situation? The driver was there, but he didn't bother, its not his job anyway. 4. Almost everyone one who has reviewed this ferry has called it very luxurious. I didn't find...

The driver was there, but he didn't bother, its not his job anyway. 

4. Almost everyone one who has reviewed this ferry has called it very luxurious. I didn't find any luxury. You are packed inside an AC cabin. It is a SMALL ferry and not a ship. It was chaos till the ferry started on its journey. No one wanted to sit at their seats and were desperately clicking pics. The way people were taking photos 'of the ferry', for a moment one would wonder if it was ""Titanic"". Please don't go with many expectations and you would be satisfied when you get down from it, that's all. I booked the cheapest ticket for around Rs. 800+, may be the costliest ones are luxurious, though I doubt. 

I still give this two stars cos I boarded a government ferry on return. The price is half that of Makruzz. The pain in government ferry is 10 times more. But if you are still visiting here, then makruzz is the only better option but beware of the painful points and plan in advance. More",Mar-13
Luxury ride,Praveen G,"Bangalore, Karnataka, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,31-Mar-13,"There are two primary ways of reaching Havelock from Port Blair. One is the Govt Ferry charging around 200 to 300 per person, with a travel time of approx 2:45 hours. The other one is Mak, which is a luxury AC cataraman, costing from 850 rupees to 1300 rupees across 3 different categories. The interiors are very good. Not much activity to do within the cataraman, rather than just spending time. The total travel time is around 1:30 hours - so you can have a quick nap. The good thing is, you dont get a vomitting feeling, since you are within AC and not totally exposed to Sea and Sun. 

We had a 2 day only plan within Havelock, so the Mak suited us both with respect to managing our activities within Havelock and making sure we are not tired of the Ride to-and-from Port Blair. 

There is a mini-canteen within this. Coffee costs around 30 rupees. Few T-shirts are up for sale too. 

Bathrooms are clean and well maintained. More",Mar-13

Can use a lot of improvement,ShareKhan4,"Sydney, Australia",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,19-Feb-13,"So this definitely beats a 2.5 hour ride in the government-operated ferry to Havelock. The Makruzz is a modern vessel, reasonably comfortable, clean and looks nice. 

They need to improve their boarding and baggage retrieval process. When we boarded, there was a huge group from Axis Bank who were going on a day trip to Havelock, so they didn't have any baggage along. There were some 35 other couples and therefore only around 40-50 bags to collect at the other end. No problem. 

However, the regular capacity is around 280 people or ~140 couples, so you can imagine the amount of luggage on a regular run. When we returned, we experienced the mess.. They need to come up with a better system of loading and retrieving the baggage - perhaps allocate into a few zones and then retrieve it and place into these zones for people to collect from. 

The bus at the Port Blair end is another pain to deal with, as our usual Indian mentality of not following any queue results in utter chaos. We avoided the bus on the return and walked from the jetty to the main entrance. 

Tip - book the Premium class seats as they are on the upper deck and the ride is a bit less bumpy in rough seas. More",Feb-13

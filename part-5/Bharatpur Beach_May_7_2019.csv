The best beach in neil island,Rengi R,"Goa, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,23-Feb-19,"The best beach in Neil Island is Bharathpur which looks exactly as a painting exhibiting beauty at the higher level. Among all my favourite beaches in India, Bharathpur has a separate space mainly because the beach does not produce any waves . Even if you venture 70- 80 m insto the sea still you will hardly be neck deep in water . We [ my wife , my son and i ] bought baloon lifbouy Ring and kept floating in the beach from 8 am to 5pm . After visiting at least 50 different beaches in various parts of india I have not seen a beach this calm . An ideal beach for a waterphile to play in. 

The extensive Bay of Bengal is beautifully lulled by the vast greenery and long stretches of white sand on the shore and tourists from all over the world love Bharathpur because of its backdrop unimaginably designed by the creator. The lagoon with shallow and clear water is an ideal space for family to have fun and enjoy the level best.

Experience at Bharatpur beach,KapoorSakshi,"Noida, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,14-Feb-19,"Found that to be too commercialized on the name of water sports.

I had been there around 10 ish in the morning, when it is pleasant to sit / lie down on the walkway and gaze out, or enjoy dipping your legs into the water. One can swim in the water as well. Depending on the tide, the corals may be right below the water surface providing a nice spot for photography (some travelers were getting themselves clicked in the water and seemed like they are either sitting / lying down / standing on the surface of water).

Even the dogs sleeping on the beach had not woken up. My husband took the kids and went swimming into the sea. The sea was quite shallow even though it looked like they had gone far in. This beach is very close to the jetty and all the water activities take place here. Even though the waters looked clear, we found the beach quite littered compared to Lakshmanpur Beach. We tried the jet ski and banana boat ride and my husband and the kids tried snorkeling on their own as they had their own snorkeling sets. However, they did not see a lot of fishes compared to Jolly Buoy and Havelock.

All the glass boats also take you from this beach. This beach is visible when you land at Neil jetty from Havelock. The tour operators of glass boats don't give up on you even if you say no.

Coral reef was pretty interesting.,SmithaSrikanth,"Chennai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,06-Mar-18,"The glass-bottomed boat ride here was interesting but if you already did it at Havelock, you might be disappointed...of course, this was just our experience. The additional snorkelling that can be done is also much better on Elephant beach at Havelock with a more professional approach. Snorkelling off the boats here might take a long time. Also, be prepared to walk about a kilometre to the beach depending on when the tide recedes. For the sheer beauty of a boat ride into the turquoise ocean, nothing can beat the glass-bottomed boat. We did not try any other water sports but jet ski rides and scuba diving are available",Mar-18
An active spot on a leisurely island,udtaparindaa,"Mysuru (Mysore), India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,04-Mar-18,"The only spot in Neil where you would find hell lot of people having fun in the crystal clear waters and enjoying the watersports too. Snorkelling(300-500), Glass bottom ride (250/person after disc), Banana Ride (600/person) are some of the tentative charges for reference. Jet ski is mentioned ?500 but they would take you for half the price as two agencies have stiff competition with each other 

Overall nice beach to enjoy watersports. 

Cons: 
1. No luggage storage space. You will have to talk to the watersports guys if you are taking their facilities or some shopwala 

2. Changing/Wash rooms are few and not in a very nice state. 
On the extreme right corner of the beach are eco huts which we came to know only afterwards. On the left theres a pathway which leads to a small guesthouse sorts (which charges you ?800/night if you wish to stay.. he was charging the foreigners staying there about 600 as they were staying for the whole month).

Water is perfect blue and is very clear in this beach.This beach has water-sports . There are many water sports here.We did glass bottom boat ride(special) which costed us Rs 1000 per person and it was good.I think this is the best place to do glass bottom ride while in Andaman as there were many tourists doing glass bottom ride here than other water sports. 

While at neil there are not many food options so we ate at a shack just to the right side of entrance of the beach.We had idly,dosas,tea and Maggi there. Idlys were too good,Dosas were average and Maggi was also very good. Each plate of Idly costed 50 Rs(four idlys in one plate),Each dosa 30 rs,Maggi per plate 50 Rs and tea Rs 20.00. Coconut water was very refreshing and costed Rs 40.00 per coconut. 

If you are coming to this beach by yourself without help of any Tour agents and coming by Auto to this beach then please take the mobile number of Auto driver and give him a call once you want to leave from Bharatpur beach,else you may find it difficult to get Autos from Bharatpur beach back to your hotel/jetty.

Just next to the Neil Island Jetty...Visit during low tide (9-9:30 AM) and spend 4-5 Hrs easily...This beach can keep you busy for 3-4 Hours... So plan accordingly and do not book return ticket to Port Blair/Havelock on 11:00 AM cruise.... 

During low tide you can literally walk barefoot 500 m into the sea and the water level wont come above your knee or above hip of your kid ... crystal clear water...clear blue at the horizon....soft sand below....calm with mild waves....you won't believe unless you visit this place.... 

the beach has a changing and wash room facility at the entrance...small eatery shops...length of trees overlooking the shore all along the beach....glass boat ride activity (if you have done any of Scuba/Snorkel/Sea Walk...glass boat ride is worthless)....

This beach is a bliss!,Nishant s,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,02-Feb-17,"This beach is a heaven for the people looking for some water sports.. You can go for a snorkeling excursion.

This beach is more commercialized in comparison to the other beaches in Neils and also a bit less pristine than the other. But this really doesn't kill the beauty. The clear blue water will leave you spellbound. 

The water is shallow near the beach and it is a perfect spot for families (elders and kids also) to play and spend some good time in water. 
The things that I liked the most about this beach is that refreshments and changing rooms are available on the beach ?itself. So it is quite tourist friendly.. In addition, you could also shop for souvenirs on the beach. 
It took me a full day to explore the beach and the activities. So i would suggest to keep aside a complete day if you are laid-back and want to relax. 

In the end, I would recommend you to reach here in the early half of the day because of the low tide (in after noon ) the water recedes and that could be a real spoiler. More",Oct-16

With a view of ships arriving and leaving from the Jetty. 
Perfect for a day in the sun and sea. I got less time to spend in this beach, because we stayed more days in Havelock Island to see the much hyped Radhanagar beach.

This beach is mostly used as a stopover for people waiting for the their boats (that arrive in the afternoon). As the hotels need you to checkout earlier in the day, people land up here with luggage. You can spend a few hours here if you try out water sports (not really cheap though!) - or just sit on the island with a book, go for a swim in the water (not too deep till 100 mtrs.), buy shell products etc. from the shops lining the beach or just click pictures.

Brilliant,pramod_5029,"Jaipur, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,27-Jan-14,Beautiful place. Nice and clean. Can see shades of blue and green in clean sea water. Lots of coral are visible. Nice place to relax at beach.,Jan-14

The swimming beach in Neil,SonjaN_13,"Tampere, Finland",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,03-Jan-14,This is the beach where you can swim in Neil since it is only one with sand bottom. Come here when it is high tide!,Dec-13
decent place to hang around,gokhs,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,02-Jan-14,"small beach. shallow waters. just adjacent to the jetty. 
you can do some shopping for sea shells products. good value for money. cannot spend more than a couple of hours here.",Dec-13
Nice clean blue beach,Rujila,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Dec-13,"One of the best beach in Neil. Very vast and not crowded at all, Its a very good place to spend ample time. You can go for water sports or just sit and relax and enjoy the beauty. Should not be missed. Very scenic. Your belongings are safe here. You can also purchase some shell items. But it is not advisable to buy anything without a vaild receipt (not even collecting loads of sea shells from the beach) , it might be an issue during check in.",Oct-13
Amazing vantage point to view sunset,Vbhan_001,"Sioux Lookout, Canada",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Dec-13,Nice sunset view would love to have shared to pictures but my camera got washed up on the sea but still would highly recommend it,Dec-13
Not nice at low tide,abcnord,"Sandefjord, Norway",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,15-Dec-13,"We were very dissappointed when we first arrived here and noticed that the beach is so shallow that at low tide it neither looks nice or offer anything of swimming, watersports. There are a few benches to sit in the shade, and stalls selling food, drinks and various souvenirs (mostly Shells, which would recommend People not to buy!). When tide rises, a lot of watersports and boattrips available 
Although we in general like dogs we found the beach dogs here at bit annoying 
Next to the jetty, it is a good Place to hang around for a while, if you have to wait for Your onward Ferry. Looks like many of the accomodations will ask guests to check out rather early More",Dec-13
One of the best Island in Neil Island,Sharmistha B,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,11-Dec-13,"I visited there on 28th November 2013. I feel it is one of the best beach of Neil Island. Went there in the afternoon, had a wonderful time in speed boat riding and the best part of it was snorkeling. It is really a good place for coral view with lots of colourful fishes moving around. During low tide you can enjoy swimming near the beach. And don't forget to carry your clothes as you cannot resist yourself seeing the crystal clear blue water which will drive you towards the sea enjoying a pleasant sea bath for hours.",
Lovely beach for water sports or simply relax..,aranhaag,"Pune, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,09-Dec-13,"Located next to the Neil Island Jetty, this beach is an ideal spot for tourist checking out of their hotels and resorts, and spending some idle time till the arrival of the cruise in the evening. 

We had to check out of our resort at 11.00 a.m. on 6th December, 2013 and the cruise was scheduled to depart from Neil Island at 4.45 p.m. The question was how to spend the time till 4.00 p.m. The best option available to us was to check out of the resort, keep our luggage at the resort, go to Bharatpur beach spend some 2 hours or so at the beach, return to the resort, have lunch, relax for some time and then move on to the jetty. 
It was during this 2 hours we could indulge in water sport activities like Glass Bottom Boat ride to see the corals, do snorkeling and speed boat ride, change the dress, have coconut water, do some shopping for coral items, and then moved on to the resort for lunch. 

The beach side is filled with broken sea shells which makes it difficult to approach the water bare foot. 
But sitting on the beach side on the wooden benches and feeling the cool breeze was a relaxing experience. 

Glass boat, snorkeling and speed boat cost Rs.600/- per head at present at Bharatpur beach More",Dec-13
Fun and frolic,Apurba20,"Raipur, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,11-Nov-13,"Bharatpur beach is near the jetty but to think that it is polluted by the onslaught of tourists would be doing the unimaginable. The beach is pristine in spite of many glass bottom boats, water skis and sofa-ride boats plying and it is the only beach in Neil where you can see people bathing. Even we did too, and will never forget the exhilarating experience.",Nov-13
Picturesque beach,Amitavac,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,06-Nov-13,"Green water...an excellent beach just beside the jetty. During low tides you will find a small patch of sand about 300 metres into the sea, where you can walk down and enjoy. One tip: if you are planning to go for the half-day tour to the Elephanta Beach of Havelock Beach (you must), then skip the water activities here. At least we did not find much corals (10-15%) compared to what we saw at Elephanta Beach. BUt great place to have fun and be amazed at the green sea.",Oct-13

Lovely beach with water sports activities,AartiShankar,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,29-Apr-13,"It is the most beautiful beach in Neil islands. I really don't know why I just loved Neil islands. Its still not developed compared to Havelock and I think that is its specialty. Many people are still not aware of Neil islands and I feel its a must visit!! Coming to Bharatpur, it is a beautiful beach with Clean and clear water. I just fell in love with the shades of blue. In short you can say, if Radhanagar : Havelock then Bharatpur : Neil Activities: It is famous for swimming, glass bottom ride, snorkeling. They charge you Rs. 200 for snorkeling. In normal snorkeling package they take per person for some 15 - 20 mins. There are also packages like Rs. 3500 for couple snorkeling for 1 and half hours or so. We did take this package. Its helpful if you are doing it for first time and need some time to adjust and practice or its a waste of money or go for the 200 rs. one its more than enough. Shopping: Near the shores there are people selling Tshirts and shell/coral jewelery.. I would suggest that you don't purchase stuff from here just cos most of the stuff come from Port Blair so you get variety there. So avoid shopping here.

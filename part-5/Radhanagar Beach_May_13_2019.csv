The best beach I have ever seen in my life,HeliosAdi,"Chennai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,10-May-19,We stayed at the Barefoot Resort which is on Radhanagar Beach and to make our way to the beach we'd pass through a patch of forest with really old trees with thick trunks. The beach in itself is rated to be one of the best in the world and from all the beaches I have ever seen in my life this was indeed the best ever. The water is pristine and the scenery is picturesque.,Apr-19
True to its identity,gaurav j,"Jaipur, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,09-May-19,"Most spectacular beach seen till date, Humongous in size and gentle waves increases the beauty of the sea.

Serene,Soppa_0312,"Pune, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,04-May-19,"The beach did not disappoint! It is a huge, huge beach with restricted area access to people entering the water for swimming or having fun. It has white sand and the water is turquoise blue which makes it the most sought to beach in the Havelock island. One can easily spend over 2-3 hours at this beach enjoying the beauty. 
The beach has a locker facility and also a changing room facility which makes it easier to enjoy over the beach without worrying about belongings. The food stalls outside the beach premises over price almost everything especially mineral water, So it is advisable to carry your own water to avoid buying water from the beach. 
It's a must visit !! More",Apr-19
SUNSET,7044454440,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,04-May-19,This is a place where you should go during sunset. The sea gives you clean big waves ideal for sea bathing. You can enjoy with your partner or family. Remember to carry towels so that you can change your clothes in public. The changing room closes at 4pm - 5pm (depending upon the mood of the authorities) which is not justified whereas the beach closes at 5.30pm. So if you are in the water till 5.30 then you may fall in trouble.,May-19
Radhanagar Beach,travelmemos,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,02-May-19,"The beach closes by 5 pm in the evening. A good place if you want to play with the sea!

The best beach in india,ps_selvakumar,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Apr-19,Needless to say this the best beach in india. The road leading to the beach itself is wonderful. The narrow road leads have both sides the supari plantation. There are shacks near to the beach where they sell snacks and meal and tender coconuts.the beach is enjoyed best during low tide. You can swim in the beach as it is safe unlike other Andaman beaches which will be rocky. The beach is soo surreal that the entrance is guarded by tall trees which is typical of Andaman. The whole stretch of the beach is covered by dense forest and forms a cove. The place where you see the dense forest and the turquoise water.. its one of best beaches in the world and i never have visited a such a beautiful beach till now. There are lockers dress change bath restaurant available. It is a sunset beach so plan your trip in the afternoon so that you can watch sun setting among the tall trees. More,Apr-19

Best beach for family but needs dacilitues,thanaelakshmanaramv,"South Andaman Island, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,23-Apr-19,The beach is fantastic. Pristine blue water with very less waves. The depth is very shallow so good for families to take bath. Sunset at the beach was a treat to the eyes. Life guards available there and monitoring the guests. So no worry. A bit crowded and facilities for bath and change rooms are really pathetic. Since stayed near the beach we could bathe and change clothes at the resort itself.,Apr-19

Swaraj Dweep and Radhanagar Beach,dhoomketu,"Hyderabad, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-Apr-19,"Holidays at the Andamans cannot be considered complete without a visit to the Swaraj Dweep, also known more popularly as the Havelock island. After checking in at the hotel we hired two Scooters from a local shop(Rs 500 per day) and drove on to see for ourselves the much talked about, Radhanagar beach. While we are at it, I would like to say that hiring a two wheeler not only solves the problem of expense but also helps in enriching your experience in the island. The long drive to Radhanagar beach is a joyous one as you pass through dense foliage of the tropical island interspersed with coconut trees. The distance is about 12 km from the circle in the centre of the island, and you cannot get lost on the way, because there are only two roads on the island. And what can be said about the beach… it is an ideal beach wallpaper come to life sort of thing. The beach is shaped like a crescent with white sand(And I mean this, do not compare this even with the one you see in Goa, it makes Goa’s sand look several shades duller) sandwiched between the multiple shades of blue on one side and multiple shades of green on the other. Only eyes can capture such a view and keep it in memory for posterity. The evening was quick as time flies when you relax at the beach, go...

Undoubtedly the best beach in the Andamans!,Ranjith3246,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Jan-19,"Once you get there, its rating as the best beach in the Andamans comes as no surprise to you. White coral sand, a gently sloping beach where you could walk upto 30 mtrs into the sea in high tide and still the water would reach upto your chest. Lovely waves. The sand is just ideal to make sand castles with if you have a small bucket and scoop. Just one spoiler... the pay and use toilet is located a bit of a walk from the beach to the left as you exit it. It is filthy and the lady attendant who (wo)mans it could have been conceived in a government office during lunch time! She just sits there to collect money. We reached there at 5.45 pm and she lied to us that the water tanks had been emptied. We still checked and found that there was indeed water coming in the taps, and lo and behold, she went behind the structure and turned off the water and came back with a smug smile on her face!

Important Points for Family,akshay21t,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,20-Jan-19,"(1) This is a sunset beach and one of the best beaches on the island. 
(2) There are limited options around the beach for eating and stuff. 
(3) IMPORTANT - There is a changing room near the beach which has a minor charge. Please make sure that you are not trying to get to the changing rooms just after sunset. There is usually a mad rush as everybody is trying to get to the changing rooms as the beach closes at 6 PM. Its stinking , there are load of mosquitoes and maddening queue. Just in case you are staying far from the beach , your driver might have told you to change and then hop in to the vehicle.......please change on the beach or just ignore.......I thought it was one fact that deserved a mention somewhere but was missing from all the reviews. 
(4) The water is awesome and so are the colors :) dont miss it for the world. More",Jan-19

A huge ""THANKS"" to the then Commander in chief and the Deputy Prime Minister ""Sardar Vallabhai Patel"" for capturing the Andamans and making it a part of United India. Andaman islands were left abandoned and unclaimed after the British left India. Exactly 24 hours after making Anadamans a part of India, Naval fleet of 3-4 nations arrived to see it was already ours. 24 hours delay and we would have lost Andamans to some other nation. Now look at the ease with which we can travel there.

Everyone recommended it and we made it a point to spend a complete afternoon here during our recent visit to the Andamans. It is located a good 10 + km from Havelock Jetty but the drive there is as scenic as can be. One of the longest beaches I have ever seen, it has a few shacks where one can keep one's belongings. There are absolutely no water sports activities, thank the lord, absolutely no vendors, wow and just no disturbance from anyone. The place is known for its pristine white sands, long walks, beautiful water and a lovely sunset. There is adequate parking available just outside the beach and a police post. I was so enamored by the lovely beach I forgot to even click photographs. However did manage to take a few photographs of the setting sun. The beach is vacated by the local police by 5:30 / 6 pm. I would classify the beach as the best in India and could even be the best in Asia. A MUST VISIT. More",Nov-18

As a result, expectation were higher. The road to the beach was not in its best shape. We parked our car few meters outside the beach, bought some drinking water and headed to the beach. 
What I saw seemed normal at the first sight. The beach was clean but so are the rest of the beaches of Havelock. The sand was shinning bright and the water was transparent but that is nothing unusual in Andaman. Giving my curiosity some rest, I headed to the water and tried to wave at my family. What I saw next was a scene to cherish. The 180 degree view from the water to the beach was breath taking. It is surrounded by hills and greenery. That makes it special. 
The other moment of awe was the sunset from the shacks. The washrooms next to the beach are very well maintained. These small things along with the calmness of the waves makes me rate this beach as the best in our country. More",Sep-17

Might be crowded, but considering that it is so famous and enchanting, everyone(just like you) is bound to visit it. Just find a corner for yourself and soak in this nature's luxury. Play in the waves. Carry some water games like ball or frishbee and enjoy! 

We had rented scooters once we reached Havelock. It is better to rent 2 wheelers as cabs would b expensive. Please be aware that the Havelock island is not that big and can be visited on 2 wheelers with great comfort. 
Carry your shades and hats. 

You will get amazing pictures here!

5. Work of guards and police requires appreciation. They especially make the beach much more safer.

One of the most beautiful sunsets I have ever seen....,brentg863,"Ashvem Beach, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,05-Mar-18,"My wife and I were wanting to catch the sunset on Radhanagar Beach. A 30 minute scooter ride, which isn't for beginner riders (!!!), provides a beautiful pre-show to the enchantment that awaits. 

You'll see farmland, villages, and lush green jungle surrounding either side of the road. Once you get there, there will be a long line of stalls with snacks, drinks and swimming gear. The beach itself was very very clean compared to other beaches that you see. 

We went towards sunset so low tide was approaching. This leaves a very wide stretch of flat sand to stroll, take pictures, and swim in the warm water. Above the beach is a rich forest with plenty of walking trails and jaw dropping trees. It's populated, yet the wide stretch of beach and forest suck the sound so it isn't chaotic. 

Highly recommend putting this on the list of must sees while in Havelock! More",Mar-18

The day we went because of clouds sunset was not visible.As the sun sets and it becomes slightly dark,life guards/tourist police at beach announces to stop bathing in beach and by 5:30-5:40 pm all tourists will have to stop bathing and will start to move from radhanagar beach to their respective hotels. 

There are some shops/vendors from the place where vehicle stops to beach where we can get samosas,fruits,meals etc.We had samosas and tea there and samosas were good.Tea is mostly made with milk powder and not milk there. 

Last bus from Radhanagar to market as per the driver of the bus by which we came to radhanagar was at 6:10 Pm. But the bus came at 6:25 pm and left radhanagar at 6:30 pm.So if you have come by bus to radhanagar beach be there at the place where where bus stops at radhanagar by 6:00 pm. we also saw a bus leaving radhanagar to market at 5:30 Pm. We saw about five-six autos waiting at entrance of radhanagar beach after sunset,so there is nothing much to worry if you miss the bus,but is safe and economical to plan to go by bus rather than by auto. 

I think the best time to visit radhanagar beach is in evening to avoid extreme heat during day. Be there at 3:45-4:00 Pm, watch sunset while bathing in sea and leave by 5:45-6:00 pm.

This is a also a sunset point in Havelock. No one is allowed to stay in water immediately after the sun is set. Life-guards make sure of that.

Radhanagar beach is on the far west end of Havelock Island. It may take upto 30-45 mins to reach here by vehicle from most of the island. There are many small food shops lined outside the entrance of the beach. They have changing rooms and toilets too. The evenings are the best times to visit here as you can see sunset from here but you will also see more crowd during evenings. Most of the crowd is in the center where some section of sea is barricaded as safe. We preferred to walk to far ends of the beach to get some privacy.

A best beach in Asia!,eskayes,"Salem, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,30-Jan-18,"Time magazine is not wrong in rating Radhanagar Beach as one of the best beaches in Asia! 

This 2 KM long and 40 mtr wide beach is the best beach I've seen in all the 20 odd countries visited by me! 

The sand is sooooo white and fine grained. Most beaches have coarse sand and loose pebbles that hurt the soles! But here all along, it was smooth sand and soft footfalls! 

There was a gentle slope for nearly 100mtr in to the sea of hip high water. Ideal for swimming and wallowing around. 

It was a pity we cld'nt watch the sunset; due to cloud cover, on the day we had gone there. 

The beach was meticulously clean due to the vigil of the authorities and co-operation of the visitors! 

Changing rooms with shower facilities are available for a fee; though cleanliness was lacking there!

One of the finest beach? Indeed !!!,Aman P,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,22-Dec-17,"Hi Guys 
I too heard a lot about Radha Nagar Beach being boasted of One of the finest beaches of Asia, by the Times Magazine. And after visiting this beach , I can tell you for sure , it indeed is one of the finest beach that I have ever seen. The gradient of slope of the beach is very low and you can feel the flat beach laden with fine white sand for, as far as you can see, during low tide.One tip is to carry an umbrella, Shades or Hats, to the beach as the Sun Shines very brightly and makes it unbearable to sit on the beach , do carry sun protection creams, and don't forget to carry some mats or sheets to sit on , as you would not find ample shady places for your parents or anyone not soaking in the water. Purchase supplies of beverages before hand as nothing is available less than double or triple of its MRP. More",Nov-17

However, last stretch of about 3 kms is not as comfortable , particularly if you use a two wheeler. But once you reach the famous beach, all that is behind and you just get soaked in the beauty of the beach. The beach has clear, white sand unlike other beaches and the stretch is also larger which makes it an idle one for tourists. The beach has a vast stretch and one can spend hours just standing there.

Great time in water,Pastakias,"Thane, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-Nov-17,"I don't know whether the rank given to this beach is correct or not but my overall experience with beaches in Andaman is that they rival the best in Mauritius. Radhanagar is perhaps the best of the lot, though I loved Kalapathar Beach equally. 

The waters are warm and gentle and the sea bed flat and safe even when you go quite a distance inside. The amazing shades of crystal clear blue and green waters that one sees are a strange sight to a Mumbaikar accustomed to see gray, opaque water in most of the sea surrounding Mumbai. It beats even Goa. The only other place where I have seen such blue-green water in India is in Jamnagar, Gujarat. There may be other such beaches but then I haven't seen the whole of India yet. 

We lazed around in the shallow (I'm not a swimmer) for over 2 hours and the amazing part was that I didn't even get sunburned. It was so wonderfully refreshing. I could have stayed in the water forever if my wife had not been gesticulating for me to get out. More",Nov-17

But the colour is seen only in sunny weather. This is a sunset beach but we couldn't experience due to raining. Changing room facilities are here at very affordable rate.

The beach is approx 13kms from Havelock harbour and the best way to reach there would be to hire a scooter. Trust me you wouldn't enjoy the ride that much in a car. The beach is huge and has lifeguards too but they monitor only a limited area. If you step out then they politely remind you to stay within their monitoring area. What I didn't find was a dress changing area in the beach, most people were using the bushes and trees nearby, this the authorities should something about. The beach area have a few restaurants but are quite substandard so the option is either have your food prior else you can have in one of the resorts before arriving the beach. We came here after spending half a day at Elephant beach where we thoroughly enjoyed.

Dramatic beauty,addytorials,"Jaisalmer, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,14-Sep-17,"We were lucky to spend a couple of months at Havelock and had a chance to visit this beach frequently - and it looked different each time. Once, the sky was full of billowy clouds and it was reflected like a painting on the beach as the tide went out. Once, the water turned several puzzling shades of turquoise and emerald when you waded in. Once there was an imposing naval ship pointed right at the shore and anchored so close you might want to swim to it. Once it was so surprisingly calm that small schools of fish would surround you in the clear water and nip at your feet (the water is so clear you can count your toes). 

Incredibly picturesque, probably the best beach in the world (and I've seen more than many). More",Jan-17

Kept clean, it provides well for the tourists with lockers(albeit a little rusted), shower and changing rooms. 
The restaurant closer to the beach provides vegetarian fare. The smaller hotels outside provide non vegetarian food which is very tasty. It would be ideal to place your order before you go in for the fun and frolic. You sure will be hungry on your way back.

The Andaman Islands not being such a developed place, there weren’t any high rise buildings or much commercialization and to add to it we stayed in a homestay with an Indian family from Chennai. They were the most accommodating and jolly people, educating us about the culture and traditions as well as the best attractions in Andaman.

If you are looking for such beach, Radhanagar beach is the one where you must head to without thinking too much. Radhanagar beach is a sandy beach spread across around 1 KM, clean, uncluttered, and equipped with all basic essential facilities. It is the farthest point of the Island. However there are few hotels adjacent to the Beach, yet it is quite far from most of the hotels, restaurants and happening places. Radhanagar beach is approximately 12 Kms from Vijayanagar & Govindngar beach. The way to the beach is through the forest so when you are returning late in the evening, it might scare you, but the road is safe. Beach can be visited throughout the day yet it is best to stay longer to watch the sun setting in the west and creating the magical effect on the surrounding. Visit the beach after lunch and spend at least 3-4 hours and return only after the sunset. Note that it is not allowed to stay in the water after sunset so patrolling guards would request you step out of water as soon as it is dark.

We did not really see any sort of activities, yet it is the best beach to spend time with family. Beach is sandy and water is shallow and clean, so you can stay forever at the beach. 

This beach is equipped with all the essential facilities. Sit-out areas have been carved out beautifully from the tree trucks or the concrete. Bathing facility with the normal water, which is chargeable, is available at the beach which is must after spending so many hours in the salty water. In addition, it has a nice restaurant to satiate the growling of the stomach. Effectively essential facilities are available on the beach. Even life-guards are guarding and patrolling the beach with utmost sincerity. 
It is certainly a place which you cannot even think of missing when you are visiting any part of Andaman. Any number of hours or number of days is not enough to soak in the charm and beauty of the place.

If you don't have clouds then you can enjoy a very scenic sunset. The orange reflection on the ocean, sand and sky makes it unbelievable. About the beach: Its a pretty long beach. It's just a pleasure to walk along the beach line. It's a different experience altogether to walk through the soft white sand and enjoy the ocean water hitting your legs. Apart from that, the mountain on one side makes it even more beautiful. If you don't want to swim in the ocean, you can just walk till the end of the beach, sit there in solitary, enjoy the beauty that the beach has to offer, witness the sunset and return back with a fresh mind. There are ample food vendors available at the entry of the beach. You can easily get snacks, coconut water, tea, water bottles, peanut etc. Overall the beach has all the basic facilities available for a tourist. Just a request to all tourist that PLEASE DO NOT...

There are life guards and security personnel on the beach too. They get you off the water when high tide approaches. Kudos ! 

There are few small eateries near the entrance to the beach as well. 

This was by far the best beach we have visited in India. The only comparison to Andamans in India is Lakshadweep, I hear.

It's a little difficult to get to (adds to the charm), though. Not sure if it deserves the title of 'best beach in Asia' - Thailand / Indonesia / Philippines might have something to say about that - but it's gorgeous, no doubt about it.

How could you ?,Davidandsally186460,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,14-Apr-17,"do this to Paradise? All the rubbish thats thrown into the sea eventually gets washed up above the tide line. Indian people dont seem to notice the trash they throw on the ground as they think clearing rubbish is the job of the untouchables. In Goa the untouchables clean the beaches every morning, getting a few rupees per sack. There seem to lots of poor people in The Andaman Islands, so come on the people who run the place, pay your poor to pick up your rubbish. And remember that The Mahatma cleaned his own toilet pan, so why dont you use the bins or take your rubbish home. We do in the UK or we get fined. Or why not do what they do in America with people who break the law. Get them to litter pick and clean or chose to go to jail. So the next time you deal in some black money think of bankers and supermodels cleaning up the sh** from the streets of New York. If you wish to be seen as a developing country, then everyone needs to take responsibilty or you remain so third world darlings! More",Feb-17

There is nothing available on the beach to eat (like goa) which is the prime reason this place is so clean. Changing room facility could be made better. It is slightly away from the beach (200-300 mtrs) and not so clean. Approach road to the beach is a bumpy ride.",Apr-17

Now I know why it is one of the best beaches in Asia,RubinaR46,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,07-Apr-17,"Our main attraction to visit Havelock was Radhanagar beach, which is apparently one of the best beaches in Asia. I wasn't sure it it would be really worth. But then we finally visited and I was left mesmerized at the very first sight of it. Bright turquoise water splashing on white sand was something I always fantasized of. The beach is too beautiful to be captured in your camera. You can experience its beauty only when you view it from your eyes in real. We visited in March, so the sky was quite clear. And clearer the sky, brighter the water would appear. The water is really good to swim, or get drenched; it's super clean and fresh. The best time to swim is after 3 PM as the UV index is lower and you would get less tan. We swam around 11 AM - 1 PM and got horrible sunburns and tan. So no matter how expensive and water-proof sunscreen you apply, it will get washed off. 

Finally, it is the only place in Havelock where you can see police and life guards, otherwise the entire island is devoid of police. I wonder how they maintain law and order in a place that gets tonnes of national and foreign tourists. More",Mar-17

"best beach in havelock, tho small compared to other places like Goa etc",shritimerchant,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,20-Mar-17,"This was my most fav place on the island. It’s easily accessible by road, though it was a little far from our resort. It’s fairly large beach, especially compared to the other beaches in Havelock. It’s very peaceful, lots of trees and beautiful clear water. It is definitely crowded as it is a popular beach, but the crowd is good and staff helpful. The only grouse I had was that there weren’t many places to sit- a few benches but not enough, and only 2 sundecks! Also there is only 1 place to eat on the beach, a small cute rooftop kind of restaurant, but they only had a set veg lunch of roti, rice, 1 veg, dal, salad and papad- no options available. There are few small stalls outside the beach gate selling fruits, chaat etc and a little further down near the parking there are shops and smaller shacks with non veg and veg food, but the shacks didn’t look very appetizing so we ate the set lunch itself which was quite good.

Cleanest Beach with a Beautiful Sunset Point,SKonambi,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,20-Mar-17,"Radhanagar Beach is one of the cleanest beach I have visited. 

We Stayed at Symphony Palm Beach Resort, renting a Motor bike next door and driving approx 10KM (6.2 Miles) in a not so good road (New road construction was in progress) we arrived at the beach. Beach itself is very clean and good Panoramic view. 

Right after you enter the beach area, you see a good crowd in beach playing. If you take a 15-20 mins walk towards right side of the beach (Or you can even walk in the woods by going past rest room), where there is no crowd and you can enjoy the lagoon all by yourself. 

There is Rest Room/Changing room - (Rs 10/- per use) and Locker rooms (Rs 10/- per hour) available near the entrance both closes at 5 PM sharp.

A Treasure,nancymcintosh44,"Niagara Falls, Canada",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,20-Mar-17,"This is one of the loveliest beaches I have ever walked. One area is filled with primarily Indian tourists having a wonderful time with families or creating hearts in the sand on their honeymoon. The rest of the soft, sparkling, white sand beach is virtually empty, with nothing but footprints and tiny crabs scurrying. The fact that no buildings are visible from the water, that only lush jungle lines the sand is remarkable, especially in this age of high rise hotels. And the water itself is warm and clean. To be able to see my toes with clarity in chest deep water was a first for me. It is aqua blue. It is my hope that this treasure will continue to be treated with respect for its natural beauty for generations to come. More",Feb-17

Mesmerizing Radhanagar Beach,gudnuse,"Pune, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,22-Feb-17,"Radhanagar beach is easily the top most attraction at Havelock Island . It is about 11 KM from the Havelock main street lined with top resorts and is reached in some half hour of leisurely drive along beautiful roads winding through verdant green cover wherever you look. The beach is cordoned by a gate at the edge of the sands. You get off the car and walk some fifty steps to the edge of the water … and it suddenly bursts before you with a mesmerizing effect. This beach justifies its reputation as being among the top three beaches in Asia without any argument. It is comparable to the finest of beaches I have seen in Zanzibar and elsewhere in East Africa. The sands are nearly white and the water is crystal clear. The emerald waters and the calm seas are enough invitation to jump in the sea and enjoy the experience. The waters are incredibly shallow such that even some hundred feet into the sea the water was only waist level . Swimming areas are well marked and flagged and the beach is under constant watch of lifeguards on duty .

On more than one occasion we noticed enthusiastic ( and somewhat careless ) parents being firmly instructed by lifeguards over megaphone to move their wards to safer areas closer to the shoreline. Around 5 pm with sunset approaching , the lifeguards ensure that everyone is out of the water . You could walk for kilometers on either direction as you take in the astounding beauty of the scene . This is also the stage for viewing grand sunset colours. 

Unlike many other beach destinations in India , this beach stands as an example of how it is possible to retain the beautiful pristine look with some discipline . The local administration should be hugely complimented for this achievement indeed. There are clear signages all over the place and notices of penalty for littering . Security guards are seen at key places and they look like they know their jobs. Shops selling tender coconut-water , snacks and fruits are located out of bounds from the beach but at a convenient distance thus encouraging people not to carry foodstuff on to the beach . We had coconut water and I wanted to carry one back for my wife who was still in the beach but the shopkeeper refused to oblige !! I promised him I would not litter the place but the shopkeeper would still not budge . He said I would be allowed to take it inside the beach upon payment of a deposit of Rs 500 , to be refunded upon return of the empty shell !! Now that is what I call discipline ! Contrast this with Goa and other beaches which have tonnes of garbage strewn about . 

There are designated shower areas / toilets available , separately for men and women for a small fee. I found the men’s shower area not well appointed and looking like makeshift structures The bathrooms were grimy and unclean looking and the whole place stank of urine. Radhanagar beach attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists and I thought they deserved better. The fee charged for shower rooms should be increased but surely better arrangements could be made !! Nature has bestowed a great gift upon Andamans and I hope someone from the Andamans admin is reading this and would consider doing something about it . More",Feb-17
Surreal Location,AnkitaA212,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-Feb-17,Radhanagar is one of the best beaches I have seen and experienced. The beach is a little far from the main parts of Havelock but totally worth the extra few miles.,Oct-16

This time the sun was bearable, but still i did not find it great. 

Most of the resorts in Havelock are on Govind Nagar & Vijay Nagar beach, where you will find backwaters and hence it is suitable for water activites like snorkelling, swimming etc. I will rate these beaches above Radhanagar.

Perfect slice of heaven,Raja S,"Chennai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,20-Jan-17,I had visited radhanagar beach with family. It's a perfectly curved beach with clean sand crystal water with lots of mangroves forming a natural boundary over the land. The waves are gentle and it's easy to swim or float or just get soaked. There are Police personnel though there is nothing to be scared of. Life guards are also on duty and make sure people don't cross the safety zone. Lockers are available till 5pm for safe keeping. Public toilets wash and changing rooms are available for a small fee and can get crowded fast. You can't stay in the water after 5pm though you can hang around on the beach. We went there thrice during our stay and never got bored. 2 days we stayed there late sitting on the benches and talking and relaxing. Make sure you carry mosquito spray as late in the evening when you are sitting on the benches the mosquitoes literally carry you away. Hope you too have a enjoyable experience. More,Jan-17

The sand is soft and extends from the edge of the forest all the way out into the surf past where you can stand without a single patch of rocks. The water is clear and clean and warm. The cleanliness of the water is proven by the abundance of fish, crabs and other wildlife present in the water. I even saw a barracuda swim by me one day!

Unlike many other Indian beaches, this place is pretty clean, and uncrowded. The density of people is a bit high near the entrance. You can walk a few steps further to enjoy the quietness and the beauty of the beach. 

In case you are a foodie - there was an interesting dish being served in the small restaurants near the parking. It looked like a large, rounded bhatura stuffed with something. Not sure if it was bunny chow or something else. Definitely worth trying. I was already full by the time I saw it, so had to skip it. More",Dec-16

I also learnt the recipe of a mind blowing fruit salad from them. :D. The immigrants who had come from Bangladesh are so innocent, warm hearted and affectionate.

The view across every inch of this beach is simply amazing. No picture can justify the scenic beauty that you see here. It's something that can be experienced first hand only. You get to see the ocean waters as far as you can see - the water seems to colour change across various parts as you move towards the shore. 

We ended being here at the time when the ocean was not calm so I did manage to enjoy and get scared with huge waves coming at the shore. Still, that did not stop me from enjoying the experience here. 

A definite must do for people travelling to Andaman. More",Dec-16
Don't Feel Like Coming Back,Manu_Pasha,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,18-Dec-16,"Fantastic Beach. Not sure whether it is the best beach in Asia but its a fantastic place to spend quality time. 

It is the Sunset point beach in Havelock with a picture perfect surroundings. What I liked more other than the beach and sand was the beautiful hillock on the edge of the beach on the south - south east direction. That was the first thing which caught my attention before the beach. 

As the beach is little far from the main market compared to other destinations it is advisable to start early. The driving experience to the beach too is one to remember. Small eateries are also present outside the beach, so no worries about having a quick eat after playing in the water and witnessing the sunset. 

So, Go and Enjoy one of the best beaches. More",Dec-16

Something that you would have seen only in movies- couple cherishing a long beach side walk, looking at sunset, crafting each other's name on sand, escaping from the world somewhere at a corner, random kissing, and lot more- Radhanagar beach offers everything. 

Out of so many beaches I have explored so far in Mauritius, Chennai, Pondicherry and Andamans, this one is the best with whom I have fallen in love with.

Good Beach but elephant beach is better,TusharV127,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,10-Dec-16,"Good Beach but elephant beach is better 

I traveled to Andaman from 22nd Nov to 30th Nov and had chosen jst2andaman tour agency. The tour was very pleasant and one of our best tour. The owner Jeetander Singh and Anju mam - +9194742-03287 themselves co ordinates the tour and the travel plan and also seeks feedback each day of your tour. 
The best part is that they keep it flexible so that we can decide which places to visit on which day. 

Recommend Ammu restaurant where the food is cheap and of good quality. Also there is a punjabi dhaba which is pure veg with excellent food in the market area near Gandhiji statue.

Great Place to Chill on a Day Off from Scuba Diving,Sidhant_Sharma,"Chandigarh, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,10-Dec-16,"While on my stay in the havelock island which was primarily a Scuba Diving vacation. It got pretty hectic after day 3 because the physical activity takes a toll on body. Day 4 we decided to take a day off and relax at the radhanagar Beach. Bike are easily rented for 300-400 rupees a day depending on bargain and radhanagar is 30 min ride from the main havelock market area. Lush green forests welcome any traveller enroute. the beach is pretty secluded from the hustle of the market area. The main beach extends for more than 700-1000 m across. Couples and families are generally found just near the beach but walking further ahead one sees isolation in true form. For me that day it became a private beach with literally no life form. So photography became a pleasure. Though a board is placed mentioning beware of crocodiles sign, i did go ahead of that. Personal opinion dont go ahead if u dont wanna be eaten by Crocks lol and make me responsible. I take no securities haha. But this beach is a must visit for anyone who visits Havelock sland More",Oct-16

Very good beach for bathing & fun..,DipakJivnani,"Surat, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,23-Nov-16,"We visited Radhanagar beach during our stay at Havelock. Auto fare for to&fro package was 600 Rs. It was fun to bath & have fun playing in sea waves on the beach. Pay & Use Shower facility is slightly away from the beach & was not enough to cater to the rush. There were more clouds, hence we could not enjoy the breath takingly beautiful colors of sea or the Sun set, which the beach is famous for. However it was enjoyable for the family.",Nov-16
Perfect place to spend the day,allforgoodfood,"Chennai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,22-Nov-16,WE spent about close to 5 hours at this place doing absolutely nothing! The beach is lined with trees and logs to sit on. As you keep walking away from the main entry it gets more secluded and is like having your own private beach. Although there are changing rooms provided I would not recommend using them. It was just easier to carry a pair of shorts to slip on and off under a skirt in one of the alcoves that the trees form.,Nov-16
Amazing,sandy_rover,"Hyderabad, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-Nov-16,One of the most beautiful beaches.. very clean and well maintained. Loved this place. Highlight of andaman trip. There are changing rooms available a little further from the beach.,Nov-16

No wonder this is rated as one of the best beaches in Asia. The location is so scenic. When we entered the water to take a dip we never that we would end up spending more than two hours here. Such a clean and beautiful beach. Water is warm and kids would love it. Beware of moving very much away from the shore towards the sea. Always stay within the eye-sight of other people. Changing rooms and locker facility is available. They even provide beach wear for rent so that even if you go there without them you can get them there. The sun set is beautiful to watch from this beach. Please note that the beach is closed to public after 5 pm since it gets very dark. Plan accordingly. We ensured that we visit this beach again the next day though it was not part of our schedule. Enjoy your time in the beach without bothering much about snapping photos. You can spend time for clicking them after playing to your heart's content in the beach. More,Oct-16
Memorable beach.,APtrips,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,16-Nov-16,"You can reach this beach by hiring cab/auto and also by government bus. But the best way to reach this beach is by hired scooter. This beach is about 11 Kms from the jetty. If you are going by scooter, you can stop at any point for taking pics or relaxing for a sip of water. The road condition is not too good, but the trip is worth it once you reach the beach. it is a wide strip and you can spend hours walking from one end to the other. There are toilets and changing rooms available and maintained neatly. There are minor hotels available nearby and for fine dining, you have TSG or even better - barefoot - nearby. The world famous elephant Rajan could be seen at this beach but sadly passed away in august 2016. More",Oct-16

There is a changing facility on this beach which is paid but clean and well maintained. 

How to reach: 
Most popular: Two wheeler. During our visit, there was some construction taking place on the way resulting in muddy roads. So it wasn't advisable. Roads are not very well maintained.400-500 Rs per day rental. 

Auto: Auto guy charges you around 400-600 for this trip saying it's very far and all. Though I must tell you that it's only around 8-10kms from jetty. 

State transport( Nobody tells about this option) 
we chose this one and we didn't regret. You get it from jetty or the central tri-section near squid restaurant. Charges are 10RS per person. Can you imagine!! and it's so clean. We met school children and they were very friendly. No one looks at you in a odd way and plus we like travelling like local so an amazing experience for us. They are available in regular intervals and drops you at radhanagar beach. We took 3 PM bus, reached in 15-20 mins and Last bus leaving from the beach is at around 5:30-6 pm.

Upon disembarking from the vehicle, you'll find multiple curio shops and dhabas. Then there's a small tree sheltered park where you can rest if it is a hot day. And then comes the beautiful beach. If you stand in the shallow water, you can even see some fish flitting about your feet - that's how much clear the water is.

Picturesque Clean white sand Beach,sudipnc,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,17-Oct-16,"The beach is very beautiful and very romantic. It is a white sand beach with beautiful waves. It is big and clean. The uniqueness of this beach is that there are thickly populated dense tall trees on the shore, that gives a very different ambience. 

It is on one end of the Havelock island and about 15 km from the ferry dock. 

The main issue is the availability of good place to eat near the beach. There are few roadside stalls (i would not say restaurants), which are pathetic. There are few restaurants nearby, but not walkable. The nearest one is the restaurant inside the resort Barefoot. This is frustrating. 

Nevertheless, it is an excellent beach and definitely the better and popular of the three main beaches. More",Jun-16

I have my personal experience with Dolphin resort and it’s really satisfactory, therefore I would strongly recommend people to stay in there. The staffs and management are really cooperative....A few points to keep in mind before planning a holiday has to be 1stly Havelock’s high temperature and 2ndly the day span which is really inadequate, therefore everything starts closing down right after sunset .

India's best treasure,ETLRwithArnav,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,20-Aug-16,"These islands are India’s best preserved treasures with neat and clean beaches with pristine beauty. Havelock Islands are located 2 hours away from Port Blair and the only access is through the water on MV Makruzz; a 5 star ferry used for transporting tourists to and fro from Havelock Islands at a very economical rate. The ride is very bumpy and it is advised not to eat too much before sitting in the boat. 
There is an old world charm in Havelock and it seems that time slows down. One can see travellers from all over the globe relaxing in beach shacks and staying for months at a stretch. Here beaches are numbered like Beach No 3 – Radhanagar Beach, Beach No 5 – where all the resorts are, etc. 
Radhanagar beach is counted among the best beaches in the world primarily because of the white sand and absolutely no litter on the beach. Unlike Goa, there are no shacks on the beach, hence no litter. Taking a long walk with waves splashing on your feet is definitely recommended. There are some shacks which serve good local cuisine but are located on the road leading to the beach. The nariyal paani is a delicacy here, with almost a litre of sweet tender coconut water for a bare minimum of INR 20-30. More",Dec-15

It's a perfect place to swim. 

Radhanagar beach is very well maintained by the authorities. It's very neat and clean. Around the beach there are palm trees and thin forests. The beach has sitting facilities and changing rooms. 

There something in either the waters or the Sun on this beach which leaves an imprint on every one who visits the beach. I was very much tanned during the 4 hours I spent on this beach. Hence, remember to carry your Sun screen lotion.

Paradise on earth...,396sanjay,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Apr-16,"Radhanagar Beach on the Havelock Island is said to be amongst the top 10 beaches in the world. And this is absolutely true. If I would have to rate this beach , my rating would be Radhanagar beach from 1 to 10 rankings. In fact I visited this beach just after two days I visited Kovalam Beach and I could feel the distinct difference between the two. This is untouched and absolutely natural beach. Crystal clear water and clean sand makes this place a paradise on earth. The beach is surrounded by dense green trees which provides a cool shade to the tourists. You can enjoy the waves for hours in the crystal clear water of Bay of Bengal or you can equally enjoy the beauty by simply sitting below the cool shade of a tree. Beautiful arrangements are there. The administration is very strict about the cleanliness of the beach, plastic bags are not allowed , you cannot spill garbage any where in the area, so be careful and adhere to the rules over there. 

My strong recommendations for the travellers for a visit to this place. You will really enjoy this place and I am sure, like me, you will definitely make a second trip to this place. More",Jan-16

I am a keen diver but my partner isn't, but we managed to do some good snorkeling together from the beach, which was fun. There really aren't any downsides to this beach. We had read that sand flies can be a problem, but we did not encounter any. In fact, when we visited other beaches on the island they were much worse. 

Top beach. No downsides. No flies. Added elephants. More",Mar-16

Serene and Mesmerizing beauty - Crashing waves and white sand beach,silent_eyee,Delhi,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-Apr-16,"Radhanagar Beach or Beach No. 7 as it was earlier called, is an amazing place where green, white and turquoise clash. The specialty of this place is the white sandy beach with the turquoise waters crashing over. It is a continental Shelf and one can walk certain distance into the water with big waves crashing over you. This was my third visit to this beach, earlier two being only day-trips, where I could only enjoy a couple of hour dip in the waters. But, this visit I wanted to stay and enjoy the beauty of this place. The beauty can only be visualized during Sunrise and Sunset. The Sunset is most mesmerizing and romantic and one should not miss it. I enjoyed walk along the shore with my wife. It was romantic and fascinating bringing you calmness and peace. One must also take the morning walk during sunrise. Small crabs and shells rule the white sand. It is spectacular view to see these small creatures crawl along.

But I was merely blown away by the beautiful sunset, the sun slowly moving down between hills just like those old pictures we used to draw in our childhood. The beach is exceptional and very well maintained without any trash.",May-15
"""Prestine""",Leon020515,India,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-Apr-16,"Wonderful beach to spent quality time with your loved one or loved ones. I would break up the beach in three parts. You have the main center part of the beach where there is most crowd, and tourists. Then we have the left hand side which is quiet, very quiet, and nice to go for a quite walk or spend some quiet time. Then you have the right hand side of the beach where people are starting to explore more as there is less crowd. 
One thing not so great are the bay watchers. Most of them look and seem like they cannot swim, let alone saving someone's life. So I wouldn't venture out too far into the sea if you're not a swimmer. 
Overall, wonderful place to play in the water as its one of the few beaches in havelock with big waves, due to the open sea. More",Feb-16

One of the beach I had spent a lot of time clicking sunset for straight 45 minutes..yeah sounds crazy, I know. But sunset was so beautiful that you would not want to miss even the single shot of changing colors of the majestic sun at the end of the horizon. 

Walked to almost the end of the beach as far as I could, climbed benches and chairs to get that perfect shot. I know, I know.. but you need to be there to understand what I mean. The sunset will take your breath away. 

We usually don't appreciate the beaches in India and look for these experiences at International location, well nothing wrong with that since I also have done the same thing. But my perspective changed once I visited Radha Nagar Beach @ Havelock. The locals are helpful, polite and humble.

Asia’s best beach,Prayag1512,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,12-Mar-16,"Radhanagar is Without a doubt the most famous beach in the Andaman Islands.

It truly is an unforgettable curve of white sand with perfectly coloured blue waters, all lined by lush forest and palm tress. It is best to have the most peaceful time without any disturbance. Just lie down and enjoy at sunrise/sunset, or go in for a quick swim. 
Due to its reputation and popularity one would expect crowds of people rushing to the beach, but the most amazingly the Radhanagar remains mostly empty compared to other popular beaches of the world. It can get bit crowded straight down the entrance but if you walk couple of hundreds meters to the left or right you will be alone again.

Maybe it is the remoteness of Havelock, but this beach is really very exclusive. Take a mat and lie down and soak in the sun or wade in for a swim...do whatever you wish.

Your visit to Havelock is incomplete without visiting this beach, and Why Havelock is called so because Haven is Locked here so HaveLock is the name, that's what i think about this place.

Tranquility Personnified,Kaushik710,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,08-Feb-16,"Visited Andamans [Havelock Island] on our Honeymoon and since then its been one of our most favorite places. Since we visited during the Off season period of September there were hardly any people save a few tourists and locals. 

At this time of the year the beach is lined with huge vines of seaweed and other small marine life washed ashore during the High tides. This attracts a lot of birds as well to the beaches. A must do is a walk barefoot along the beach either early in the mornings or in the evenings before the high tide sets in. At every turn the beach does not cease to amaze you. A long line of Huge tall green trees stand guard on the beach , as if to say "" we have got your back..."". As opposed to the other beaches in Havelock island there are not many resorts along this beach except for one. 

The waters of Neils cove is also a beautiful sight to watch. Would have been nicer to get in but its banned because of an incident with a Crocodile a couple of years back.

we stayed near kalapaththar beach so it was bit far from our place.Renting a bike solved the problem and gave the road fun,too!!Road is very narrow and sometimes no road at all,so the biker as well as pillion rider needs to be cautious 
every time.Lots of mosquitoes will give accompany after sun set everywhere in havelock even while driving! 
And most interestingly,there are only two ATMs in havelock while both are in ""not working state"" most of the time! So please keep many ""printed valuable gandhiji"" with you!!

Due to its reputation and popularity one would expect crowds of people rushing to the beach, but the most amazingly the Radhanagar remains mostly empty compared to other popular beaches of the world. It can get bit crowded straight down the entrance but if you walk a couple of hundred meters to the left or right you will be alone again. 
Havelock is a good place to stay with many good hotels, but we preferred our night stay at Neil. We had to catch our boat at around 3.00 pm. So we preferred to have our lunch in a local shack/motel/restaurant, whatever you may call it. A big hut on the road side, with enough seating arrangement, and clean also. This is being managed by a young Bengali couple with a helping hand. The lady in charge of the kitchen, the gentleman managing front desk showed us fresh specimens of crab, fish, lobsters and ready to cook and serve if you desire. 
If you plan to stay there and have the opportunity of trying your hand at cooking, then you can cross the road and enter the building where lies the fresh sea food market. Believe me they are fresh catch from the sea …and must be tasting heavenly. This is a piece of suggestion, in most of our coastal India, you will find small hut restaurants, and the dishes there are much better than any star one, because you are getting your favorites, fresh from the sea not from Unhygienix who brings his fish from Lutetia.

Beach area is fantastic and very very long . It would take almost an hour for a walk on the beach from one end to another. 
If ur a couple who wants to get away from the crowd just head over to the end of the beach where you can enjoy the calm but please only do the swimming within the lifeguards sight.

Awesome family beach.,plumpoo,"Amritsar, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,08-Jan-16,"Ok. So lets write for full Andamans.. Cost @ 50000/- person. Stay @ port blair 2 days( including day of landing) . Havelock - 2 days min. , Neil- 1 day. 
Ppl are super nyc. Radhanagar is the main beach of Havelock. Its a clean long beach. u can spend day here. water sport is not allowed here. for that u goto to Elephanta beach from Havelock , which is another great beach but ur not allowed to stay at elephanta. U take a ferry from Havelock for elephanta and return after 2-3 hrs from same ferry after water sport. Scuba Diving @ 2000-2500 is available. At elephanta , sea walking is a must do and easier than scuba.Those unable to do scuba shud try this sea walk. 
Neil islands have a couple of great beaches. clean white sand beaches and with not so deep sea beds and hence u can go inside sea quite far even if u don't know swimming like me.

7. The huge and lush green trees give it a distinct look. I couldn't decide where to look - towards the enigmatic horizon or the thick forest on the island 
8. No sea weed, no touristy trash - pure bliss in and outside of water 
9. Lastly, the beach looks most beautiful when it rains (and it does rain heavily on most evenings) - check out some photos with this post. We were lucky to experience the beach in both the sun and rain. 

We visited this beach twice during our stay and it was worth every penny spent on the travel (local travel in Havelock is expensive and we paid INR 1000/- for each trip to the beach). 

You may leave Radhanagar but Radhanagar will never leave you. It will stay in your most pleasant memories forever. More",Dec-15

Contrary to the Indian mainland beaches the sand at this beach has a silver hue and not too granular which is just perfect for a barefooted stroll or a dip in the ocean. 
Also,the beach has a largely even seabed and one can walk deep into the ocean without the fear of being swept away by the undercurrents.

It is accessible by both government and private ferries with rates depending on which one you choose (cheaper being govt ones, of course). The travel time from Port Blair (which is the main town in Andamans) is approximately 2.5 hours by the ferry. Nothing much is there to be seen enroute but Havelock Island itself is a tourists paradise. Crystal clear waters and Radhanagar is one long stretch of clean white sand which fascinates right from the first glance. No wonder it has been recommended by National Geographic Magazine as a ""must see"". Water sports are available for the adventurous but you could just spend time relaxing in the shade or else frolic in the clean waters of the sea. 

The beach is accessible both by taxis and public transport which leaves at fixed intervals from the jetty. Eating options are limited so be sure to stock up else be content with coconut water which is easily available in plenty.

It's a beautiful long crescent framed with white sand and the shoreline is lined with dense trees that block out any view of any man made structure that lines the area. This gives it a very isolated untouched look. 

Not very crowded, nevertheless we decided to take a right turn and walk further along the beach to go to more isolated areas. I highly recommend that. 
Oh the ominous warning of crocodile greet you as you step onto the beach. Usually a good idea to respect that even though the unfortunate tragic event occurred more that 5 years ago. 
Salt water crocs are the inhabitants of the nearby islands. They belong there. I believe we need to respect nature and enjoy it with due respect to all its citizens. So go enjoy the beach but respect your boundaries. 
Australian beaches coexist hand in hand with the greatest predator on earth, the Great White shark. We need to learn lessons from that. 

Okay back to the beach. 

The sand is the softest I have ever walked on. It's like powder. Carry the flip flops. Let your toes go mental in that amazing feeling. 
This texture of sand gives an incredible look to the sand when the water recedes. The sand becomes lol glass at an angle. Do notice that and let your creative photography juices flow to their fullest.

Yes, the beach was clean and the surroundings have been well maintained but it had nothing extraordinary that makes it the best beach in Asia. The sunset was not all that fascinating as it was little cloudy. In my view, in Havelock, all the beaches look awesome during the day time. When the sun is shining bright, that is when the beaches come out in full bloom with the touch of the turquoise blue water. The roads to drive down to this place is very narrow.",Oct-15

"""best beach in Asia award"" Agreed!",teamlbsb,"Vancouver, Canada",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,08-Nov-15,Beach 7 is heaven. This place is heaven on earth. Loads of tourists though but they stick together close to the beach entrance. Long walks down the beach and swimming is a great way to spend any day. UNFORTUNATELY i have to knock off two stars and i actually should take off a couple more. Why? Well there is also a poor old sad Elephant in the forest. He's kept until a rich tourist comes and pays to walk with him down the beach and bath him etc. We saw this first hand and it was heart breaking. For some reason most people were okay with this. The elephant had at least 5 wounds that we saw and his eyes were SO sad that i was almost in tears. So yes this beach is beautiful but watching people turn a blind eye to animal cruelty is horrible. In fact they are participating it in when they pay to be a part of it. If you don't know about this or understand why it is cruel please search it on-line before you pay to be part of this.

People who visited both islands told that Neil island may be avoided if you compare beauty of both islands. You can spend any number of days in Havelok island.

Long rows of tall, green trees line the shore as the forest suddenly opens out on to the seashore without a warning. Ideal for long walks along the seaside, this is a neat, beautiful and huge beach that attracts a lot of people. We saw what looked like elephant foot-marks that led into an opening in the forest. However, before we could conjure fantasy stories around wildlife running wild by the seashore, we learnt that elephant rides are regularly organized for tourists on the beach.

Best place to see in life time,GuideMKN,"Chennai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,02-Sep-15,"If you are on a visit to Havelock, do allocate 2 - 3 hours and during the evening time. Visit before the peak season begins or after. Its serene and when the sun sets, the reflection of it falls on the beach which is washes of by the waves. You will enjoy those moments. You could lay on the sandy beaches and rest for a while. Before you make an entry to the beach you could find person selling tender coconut and he would be saying of 1 liter of water in it. Its worth a try. Its true. Drinking the tender coconut water from that place fills your stomach. Have a pleasant walk on the beach, Take snaps snaps. Enjoy More",Aug-15

Clean and swimmer friendly beach in Havelock,cvasanthk,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,10-Aug-15,"What was most striking about this beach was a very picturesque setup with public friendly amenities and its cleanliness. Pergolas well laid out, wooden benches for people to sit and enjoy the waves kissing the beach, watch their loved ones swimming or playing in the waves, a paid bath and wash rooms for the public to use and in the midst of tall shade providing trees. I would have wished the wash rooms to be kept a bit more tourist friendly in terms of its Cleanliness considering it is a paid service. There is a restaurant in the beach which we didn't try and looked empty most of the times during our visit to the beach. 
Important to note is that there were all round alert lifeguards watching the swimmers. This makes you feel extra safe while you are playing or swimming in the clear and clean waters. The greenery, the white sand , the facilities in the beach, the beauty of the waves sets this beach amongst one of the best in Havelock Island.

The sunset is spectacular here--- the sun sets in the trees-- and the sight is breathtaking. The beach is all around surrounded by the dense forest with very tall trees. On the beach front, there are ample place for sitting, relaxing or even enjoying swings.

Scenic Beach,Guha Rajan M,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,05-Aug-15,"Very nice beach in Havelock Island near Adhaman. 

I still feel Wandoor beach at Andhaman more scenic than Radhanagar beach at Havelock Island. The main reason being from the shore of Wandoor beach one could sport about 10~12 island with greenery. However in Havelock island it a neat beach with Greenery around. If you had visited Goa beach, then this might not excite you that much. 

However, the main attraction is about getting to Havelock island. From Andaman one need to take a cruise or ferry which private or Govt. We preferred Private cruise and we had a challenge. Being an off-season and peak monsoon season (July) some of the private cruise like Makrooz,coastal cruise had stopped operation. There was only Green Ocean which was available. The Green Ocean has been introduced recently and the 2 hours journey from Port Blair to Havelock was fantastic. Being an off-season there was not much crow in the ship and we were able to roam around in the open upper deck and watch the ocean waves & scenic view of islands nearby. 

Once you reach Havelock island, Radhanagar beach is about 10km and one need to hire cab, auto or take a govt bus. In all it was quite a scenic beach and not to be missed during visit to Andaman. More",Jul-15

Pros 
1.Very Less people as compared to rest of the country 
2.Beach has lots of secrets walk right as far as you can go.And you will get lonely and lonely and feel good. 
3.Carry water bottle if you are planning a long walk.You will get it from the vendors when you enter the beach.And please do not make the place dirty. 
4.If you are not a good swimmer do not enter into the waves its strong. 
5.If you are planning for few shots by the beach carry the bottles with you. 

Cons 
1.Very less life guard in case of emergence. 
2.If you smoke do not rent a bi cycle and plan to go there. 
3. Carry your own towels and beach wear you wont find anything out there. 
4.No good food vendors. 

As i am a budget traveller for me the time to visit was off season Aug to Nov,i got 50% discount on everything from,scuba to grill lobster,hotel to huts just every thing.And best part very less people will be out there.But booking the ferry out of have lock and getting reservation for that will be tough in off season as few ferry travels at that time.Even Touts wont be able to help you out. 
There is also a chopper service from Port Blair to Have lock.

Nature should be kept undisturbed for better human living. Today is World Environment Day. In my opinion, Andaman Islands visit is for its nature and not for any other activities like water sports.

We stayed in TSG Blue resort which is very close to Radhanagar beach. 
The beach is with clean white sand. No littering any sort of filth. Water is very clear and blue. The sea is shallow may be up to 500 to 800 feet distance into the water. Hence, it is a safe beach too to get into the water and enjoy. If we go in the morning, there will not be many people. As the day progresses people will start thronging. 
It is the most enjoyable place. Mostly families and newly wed couples are seen here. 
I have seen beaches in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Goa and Odisha. Nowhere I could see such a clean and beautiful beach. 
It is the most picturesque beach ever I have seen. Words are not enough to explain. So I have attached a few pics which will explain more. 
Another advantage here is, the facilities available. There is a cloak room to keep luggage, change rooms for changing the wet cloths, which is more useful for ladies, couple of restaurants etc. All are clean and well maintained. 
Elephant raids are available daily in the morning by around 10 which kids will enjoy. it was a memorable visit to this beach. More",Feb-15

The Radhanagar main beach has showers and toilets with some food shacks. Beach chairs are available for rent - though no one came to ask for any rent when we used them. The best part of the beach is how clean it is - like the rest of the Anadamans. Definitely worth visiting ...again and again...

No alcohol is sold near the beach will get in resort. The beach is too clean one can walk barefoot. The best part is you can leave your belongings on the beach no one will touch your belongings it's that safe but precautions are always recommended. You can buy small kids toys which kids would love to play on the beach. Beach is too safe..There is a restaurant too close to the beach but should avoid eating on the beach.

Gracious,SubirBose,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,16-Apr-15,"I heard that Radhanagar Beach has been named as the number one beach in the world by Time Magazine. Since, earlier I have visited several sea beaches of India, I had a belief that this one would also be just like other sea beaches. But visiting Radhanagar beach, I have changed my idea. What a sea beach, it is! Clean white sand with tolerable Sunshine, crystal clear water and with great ambience the beach is ready to serve you a divinely feelings. 

From our Resort (Blue Bird) it was around 14 kilometres. Auto fare (to and fro with waiting charge) Rs.500/-. One can also opt for the Bus, starting by the Jetty (fare Rs.10/- only). Be rest assured that everything here is pretty costly. Tea – Rs.15/-, SINGARA – Rs.15/-, Coconut – Rs.30/- etc. 

There is Temple of Lord Shiva just 500 metres away from the main beach and if you are interested to walk more 500 metres, a temple of Radhakrishna is also there to greet you. 

Try to be there during the afternoon session to watch the gracious Sun set here. More",Apr-15
MY BEST BEACH HOLIDAY EVER,RMAggar,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,15-Apr-15,"Time spent researching a good beach for your holiday is the time well spent.

It is the best choice for those who prefer a greener lifestyle. It is an ideal place for those who love to be in the complete silence of nature. It is a breathtaking beautiful beach. The surrounding areas of the Beach are divine- rich in marine life. 
Radhanagar beach at Havelock Island of Andaman Islands has been awarded as one of the best and spectacular beaches of Asia. Silver-White sand of the beach and aquamarine greenish - blue Sea with rain forest as the background looks really inviting for a tourist and the place is unique. A place you can go to be alone, to get away from all. A spot under a shady tree might be your favourite retreat from maddening city or your bedroom. 
This is a beach not yet so popular to be polluted with empty cans of beer, plastic water bottles, or even crowded shacks. There is town on its doorstep. The beach is also very safe for swimming. It is the place to have a gulp of fresh air free from all the adulterations of a city life. The waters are sparkling blue and devoid of any wave action. It is almost vacant and the serene environment adds to the romance. All put together it practically demands us to sit-back or lay around. Tourists from all corners of the world flock the place for meeting new people, clicking great pictures & adding beautiful moments to their holiday album. It is a nature’s gift to our beloved country and our sacred islands. 
Picture-perfect scenery, exceptionally colourful reefs; and the best glimpses of orange sunset; what a beauty! But still untrodden. More",Apr-15

Clean water and a long beach with a fantastic sunset make for an amazing sight. There are some restaurants and shops selling trinkets on the approach road but the beach itself is free of hawkers and shops.

Top notch!,Parosite,"Paros, Greece",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,04-Apr-15,"Yes, Radhanagar is not only by far the best accessible beach in India (there are some great ones on the uninhabited islands, but difficult and expensive to get to), it is up there among the world’s best. I am not saying this lightly, having visited many of the top beaches in the Caribbean, Latin America, Asia, Australia, Indian Ocean and South Pacific Islands. White sand and amazingly clear water backed by spectacular rainforest. 
If you have the privilege to stay there, go down to the beach just after sunrise and you will have the place pretty much to yourself. Most of the day visitors stay close to the parking area anyway, so if you are ready to walk a bit it is easy to find your own stretch of paradise. When I visited the bodysurfing was awesome, while other travellers reported decent snorkelling at Neil’s Cove in calm conditions.

Asia's most beautiful and the world's 6th beautiful beach it is and you can know it only when you step on its finest sands, cleanest waters and witness the sun set gracefully behind that infinity which calls you with every rising wave. We visited this beach twice during our 5 day Andaman trip and each moment spent was more than worth. The first visit was to view the full sunset with hours of volley ball and the second visit was to just dissolve in every bit of the sea waves which had enchanted us already.

And there's also good forest next to the beach if you'd like to be in the shade yet almost on the beach. 

With the beach being off limits for vendors - it is neat and clean. Vehicles and bikes are parked in an orderly manner at the roadhead. The re are eco changing rooms for men and women if you'dlike to change in private. 

A couple of eat shacks and memento shops are lined up near the roadhead in an orderly manner. Also a couple of fruit salad vendors and tender coconut vendors can keep you eating healthy food.

Clean beach with a stunning sunset view !,261saiprasads,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,25-Mar-15,"Radhanagar, also known as beach no7 in Havelock, is undoubtedly an excellent place to relax and experience beauty of nature. Soft, white sand, crystal clear blue water and its cleanliness is what will make you stay at the beach for hours 
If you are visiting this place, Do Not miss the sunset. It's Amazing !!. Would suggest to reach here at around 3Pm. By 515-530pm, sun sets and it starts getting dark. If you have hired a bike then leave by 530 as the road is hardly lit with street lights and is very narrow with many turns, so can be dangerous to ride in dark.

The entrance, was very unlike of other beaches in India. The entire area was very clean, neatly arranged and the padauk trees had given a rousing welcome... 

Everything there was quite spic and span 

Spending time in water was splendid and snorkeling was also quite great amongst so many people. We could unfold three to four varieties, even more I guess, of fishes who never shied away from coming towards the shore, was quite unbelievable for me. 

The beauty of the sea at noon was breathtaking, the sun rays falling directly on the sea brought the actual flair of sea... 

After spending time in morning session, having a coconut water was quite special. The water was really one best naturally sweetened drink I had had. 

Towards the evening, we had been here for sunset, it was really enthralling time there. The day was concluded on such a high note, with a wonderful sunset, had returned home highly satisfied. More",

As we neared the sun tanned marvelous beach with never-seen-before shade of blue, first reaction that I had was I am watching something that I had only seen in hollywood movies until. Radhanagar is on south-west end of Havelock island and offers a 30-mins fun ride via car, bike, or an amazing nature's trail that takes over 1 hour, but should be done with help of local guides. Not much far from the beach, there are couple of private properties, Barefoot resort being one of the most sought after affluent places in Havelock. Sea is virtually crystal clear and is excellent sport for surfing. Neil's Cove is another beautiful, serene place little far away from main Radhanagar beach. Me and family spent a happy and refreshing afternoon here and to our surprise, when we returned next day for dinner at Barefoot resort, it was full moon night and we witnessed the never-forgettable sight of a sea of silver.

Huge Beach - Smooth Sands - Beautiful Sunset!!!,Travel_Akanksha,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,06-Mar-15,"There is a good reason why this beach is considered one of the best beaches in India.

Agreed that the beach gets crowded in the evening, esp. closer to sunset, but it is such a massive beach that you will surely find a nice corner to seclude yourself and enjoy the water and sand. It is very comfortable for people who want to swim in the sea as the water is not too deep to large extent. They have lifeguards - which is good considering the sheer number of people who visit the beach. There are washrooms and changing rooms - and swimming trunks are available for hire/purchase. The beach closes soon after sunset - and then the shops outside come alive with food and other offerings.

Must visit Beach in Havlok,rpsingh54,"Mohali, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,18-Feb-15,A very long neat & clean beach to relax or for walk along the sea. The sunset view is excellent here & not to be missed while in Havlok. White sand & blue water makes this beach one of the best in Asia. No water sports on this beach. There are small shops at the entrance for sale of Andaman stuff. No much options for food only cut fruits & narial pani available.Some good resorts are nearby from where you can go walking for early morning walk or to see sunset view in the evening.I shall recommend to everyone to visit this beach if you plan to go to Havlok.

Fantastic beach..,Shifad53,"Kochi (Cochin), India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,18-Feb-15,"One of the most beautiful beach i have seen. The beach is well maintained by the authorities. The water is clean and also very clear. Near to the entrance they have the washrooms and lockers. Also there are some small shops which sells snacks, coconuts etc outside the main entrance. If you are going to Andaman , you should never miss this place and you should allocate more time for this beautiful beach. Try to spend an evening here so that you can see the sunset also.",Sep-14
Yet to see a more beautiful beach,Sachin_IN,India,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,17-Feb-15,"Have been to many beaches, but seriously this place is second to none. The reason why it doesn't figure in top 10 would be just lack of reviews. Have been there three consecutive years straight, and even with increasing hub dub on this tiny island, this place doesn't loose charm. Just visit there and lie around the entire day. And kindly carry back whatever you carry on this island, it can't handle waste anymore.",Jan-15

Best beach !,Ketan B,"Pune, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,17-Feb-15,"Radhanagar beach - This was by far the best beach i have seen in my life so far. It has very long seashore. We came to the beach from the hotel Barefoot's private entrance and were simply awestruck by immense sea shore in front of us. We took left to see how far we can go. After walking for some time, we reached part of the beach which is main entrance. We continued walking and reached an area where there were some rocks but no direct sand (still pretty walkable if you have shoes). We decided to come back and by the time we came to hotel entrance, it was almost two hours! 
The beach has very beautiful white sand and clean water. On the right side of entrance, if we walk for some time, we reach what is called Neil's Cove. There is a board which warns against swimming in this area saying that salt water crocodiles have been spotted here. Radhanagar beach is very clean and thankfully government has made sure it is left that way. There are no food outlets on the shore for people to convert the beach into ""chaupati"". More",Feb-15

One of the gems of India..,SandeepJana,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,15-Feb-15,"Okay unlike most of the people , reviews n magazines which call it the best beach in Asia , I will not call it that as I found the Kaala Pathar beach in Havelock more inviting. 

But nevertheless it is indeed one of the most beautiful place, if not in world , than for sure on Indian subcontinent. 

It has everything that one want in a beach. 
Beautiful white sand, vast stretch of clean land, blue emerald water, inviting waves, water at appropriate temperature to keep one glued to and a belt of green lush trees with small tree houses n huts. 

It was just at 5mins walk from our hotel thus allowing us to watch one of the most beautiful sun set. 

You could for sure spend a whole day walking, bathing and relaxing here. 

One is not allowed to go into water after 5:30 and the beach lights are switched off at 7:30 but still the beach is quite safe for one to take a stroll at night. 

Definitely one of the best attraction in Havelock More",Feb-15

Never Miss this Whie and Emerald Beauty,GolakaNath,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,02-Feb-15,"Oh! What a place. Clean white sand beach with very few people around you in the beach taking bath in clean water. The view is mind blowing. You see pure blue and emerald water every where. You must walk for about 1.5km in the entire beach to cover one side. The beach is about 20 minutes car ride in a bad road from the Havelock Jetty. To reach Havelock Jetty from Port Blair, you need to either take Makruzz or Government ferry services. We preferred Makruzz as it was clean and you can book online for the same. Government Ferry will be cheaper but the preference is for local people. The Makruzz takes 90 minutes to reach Havelock from Port Blair but Government Ferry will take about 3 hours or little more. If the sea is not smooty, be prepared for sea sickness and must carry sickness bags if you have young children travelling with you. Once you are on the Radhanagar beach, there are enough place to sit in the shade near the entrance and in between small siting places are available. Enjoy the sea waves and greenery all around. Toilets are few and only on ladies toilet. You must see the colour of water here. No nearby good restaurant for food. You can get good amount of fresh fruits salads from stalls at the entrance of the beach. Food options are very poor. No other activity except bathing... Oh! What a place.

The water is turquoise blue, clarity of water is superb. you can spot silver fish quite often. The coast guards are very strict, they don't allow you to stay in sea after 5 pm which is good in a way. Loads of policemen are there looking after you. Safest tourist destination I would say is Radha Nagar beach.

Drove to Moonshine restaurent for dinner of excellent fish fry n omlette n sandwich.It is like a beach shack but not near beach.just enroute to pearl beach resort .Seychelle htl is also enroute.Again had the usual buffet so did not eat there. 

Got porter with cycle richshaw fr rs 150.

Wish they cleaned the makruzz windows n jet airways plane windows so one looked out of clean clear windows instead of dirty windows. 
Meals n variety on jet airways too spicy n boring.not very tasty just edible. 
Staff on jet very courteous n helpful. 
Andaman airport staff see too many tourists perhaps.just apathetic indifference in general.Notices everywhere should just clearly say one cannot carry back any dead shell or dead coral collected on beaches. 
Jet airways we were served the same oily cutlet n chicken tikka masala .fruit twice as snack n dinner.Awful. More",Jan-15

Another beautiful creation by Mother Nature,pratiti,"Navi Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-Jan-15,"Radhanagar Beach with its crystal clear water simply took my breathe away. When India itself has such a heavenly place, there's no need to go to Phuket or Phi Phi or Bangkok. The only difference is the tourist places in India are poorly maintained & neglected by the Indian govt itself. However, the people of this island are doing a great part in maintaining the beauty of this island. A must visit is to this beach to see the sunset. Truly beautiful.",
Definitely the best place in Andamans,Naz X,Kazakhstan,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-Jan-15,"I have already seen many nice beaches in other countries and the first impression wasnt as good as I expected but after staying in Andamans for nearly 2 weeks can say now that Radhanagar beach is definitely one of the best attractions there. White smooth sand, crystal clear water and not so crowded despite being the popular place in Havelock. Walking along the beach is very pleasant without worrying to see pails of rubbish or heart yourself because of coral and shell bits. There was a restaurant but only serving Indian meal so if wish to eat something different then better go to The Barefoot Resort restaurant which is 3-4 mins walk. One can have elephant ride for 5-6 mins around the bushes and I guess it was the only elephant in whole Andamans, not sure where the 2nd one on post cards came from :-) but honestly, it is a nice place and you may appreciate it more after visiting and comparing with other beaches. Nice busy mini market just outside the gate and if you wish to feed the elephant then be aware that the cost of the bananas is more expensive than the elephant ride :-) and a great find for us was a watermelon!

If you are couple and want to spend some time alone you might have to some space on the right side once you arrive at the beach. 
We wanted to see the sunset but it was cloudy. Hence missed it. But I wonder anyone would be able to see the sunset here, as the islands extension might fall as an obstruction. 

The washroom near the beach was simply stinking and dirty. Prepare properly if you plan to take a dive in the sea.

The beach is very very clean and the white fine sand is something that you would definitely like. The wave is not that strong, so taking a bath is very much safe and enjoyable. We visited at around 2:00 pm for the bath and the beach was almost empty with only 2 - 3 other couples present there. We were on the far right side of the beach where you will find solitude.

Though this half moon bay is very pretty, white sand, beautiful waves and the coconut palms and the tropical canopy very inviting, i have to say if you look closer, there is a WHOLE LOT rubbish along the beach, empty bottles, plastic bags, just like if nobody cares, maybe this is only in low season..... there are lifeguards on duty, obviously for a reason ( the waves are sometimes very big and one woman was killed in 2010 by a saltwater crocodile there while snorkelling....) there is strange spaceshiplooking accommodation, and a lot of makeshift restaurants, as i can assume, its best to visit as a daytrip and you are better off staying on the other beach along the village ,there you have more options for walking, seeing, eating and so on. by the way, be prepared, that the local bus driver plying the village-radhanagar route (every 2 hours or so....)thinks he is former F1 racer michael schuhmacher, even the locals are not relaxed sitting back in the bus-I was scared to death, be careful if you rent a bycycle to go there, when the bus passes its advisable to jump in the next ditch. hope this gives a good overview More",Jul-14

Port Blair to Havelock Island 
The only way of transportation between these two island is through ferry –either Govt or a private catamaran. The Govt ferry leaves early in the morning at 06:30AM while the private ferry (Mak Cruise) leaves at a comfortable time of 08:15 am with charges ranging from Deluxe—850/ and Premium—975/ and takes about one and half hour to reach Havelock while the Govt ferry makes a detour to Neil island first before docking at Havelock. 
The catamaran was a sturdy seafaring vessel and ticketing, check in and baggage handling is akin to any airport with comfortable deck chairs in sun shaded air conditioned cabins with all the basic amenities including a cafeteria with a friendly crew and a captain to make your voyage a memorable experience as it proudly glides through the green translucent water and dark green islands to discharge you at the Havelock Island precisely at the arrival time. 

Havelock Island 
We saw the sea here in its infinite glory, ethereal glow of moonlight and surreal rays of the rising and the setting sun. 
Try to book a hotel on Vijaynagar beach. The sea is gentle, clean and with swaying palm fronds, dark green islands dotting the horizon and the Gods playing with infinite colours at the horizon during dusk and dawn gives an out of the world experience. 
The main attraction of Havelock island is the Radhanagar beach. It’s about half an hour drive from the town centre and do not forget to carry your swimming costume. As you are about to enter the beach there are rows of fisherman eating shacks serving hot vegetarian and non-vegetarian foods especially exotic local fresh sea food made with homely touch, taste and love. These shacks also double as cloak room in case you have checked out of your hotel to catch the evening ferry. Order your choice of dishes before you head for the ocean because after 2-3 hrs of splashing around you would be famished to the core to wait for even a minute for the hot sumptuous meal. Another great attraction for the foodies are the rows of fruit chat venders who mix and match the seasonal fruits with chutneys to tingle your food buds to orgasmic frenzy. 
The beach has decent changing rooms and decent waves breaking down on its neat silvery sand beach where every person despite his age and sex threw themselves in gay abandon at the tireless rolling swells, surfacing with the taste of salt water, blinking at the clear blue sky, and for a moment when you look around the world seems in perfect balance till the next mighty wave comes crashing down. 
Hungry and exhilarated you trample back to the gastronomic delight of warm fresh fare awaiting you at the fisherman shacks vowing to do an encore every year but not before you had the largest and the sweetest tender coconut to finish your meal. 
The Kalapathar beach so named because the area is inundated with black stones is not as popular despite being a scenic one and is amust visit if you have time to spare. If you are an adventurous and extrafunloving couple scooty is the way to travel around this island. 
Next when the time came to rid the ferry back to Port Blair- I promised that I will be back soon because “The cure for anything is salt water-sweat, tears or the sea.” More",Oct-14
The Best Beach in India.,jyotikakarve,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,16-Dec-14,"The small opening ushering you into the beach area seems very crowded and commercial but only when you step onto the soft, serene,sand that the splendour of gods world is fully revealed. If there ever was a beach made specially for the Gods to enjoy themselves, it would be the Radhanager Beach. The beach is a large cove almost as if made to show us humans the power of the almighty. Thick rainforests pour onto soft white sand which merges into melodious waves slowly caressing the beach. The sunset is unparalleled to any that one has seen. The hills, the forest, the sand, the beach, the water,the sky, the clouds, the Sun, all spread out to make a perfect sunset. Definitely not to be missed when visiting Havelok More",Dec-14

Beach is so clean that even after 150 meters inside the sea we can see our feet clearly. beach is shallow and water rose to around 4-5 feet even after 100-150 meters deeper into the sea. very calm, very safe no violent wave. A perfect beach for swimming and bathing. Sun set was Awesome. Locker facility is available though not required because whole of Andaman is a super safe area.

I think the above line says it all, but for details ~ The moment you will step at Radhanagar beach, you will be mesmerized with its beauty. Amazingly clear blue water and silky soft white sand will take your heart away. 

Have fun with your loved ones at the beach and you will remember it for years to come. Appropriate arrangements like Lockers and washroom is available at the beach at nominal cost of Rs 5 to 10. 

Route and stay ~ Way to Radhanagar beach is very beautiful and you gonna enjoy the journey on scooty. If you wish to stay here for a day, you can book yourself at Barefoot resort which is expensive I must tell you, or Swiss domes by Andaman Tourism at Rs. 2500 per night. 2nd one is a Value for money but are only 4 in number. 

Food ~ After all fun activities, if you feel hungry, try 'Maya Restaurant' and don't miss their special fish curry prepared by owner Navin. You will love it.

Hard to believe this place exists,Ppronto,"Bokaro Steel City, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,25-Sep-14,"Infrastructure wise, not much. perhaps that's the USP of this place, because it sure is a deterrent for the crowds. To really experience the beach, one needs to stay at least 3 nights. We stayed at the A&N tourism provided tents. Facilities were basic, but the setting was so good, it seemed sinful to ruin it by asking for anything more than just individual privies, running water and electricity, which they had. The food at the privately run shacks at the doorstep was fresh, tasty and cheap. Drinks may not be so easy. Best to bring your own from Port Blair to this place. Of course there is a better appointed and costlier resort nearby: The Barefoot. 
This place is a tropical paradise. If you are staying on the beach, you can have to whole place to yourself throughout the mornings, since the day tripping boat tourists arrive just before noon. You can ride an elephant, order the catch of the day, cooked the way you like, drink all the rum with coconut water cocktails you want, lounge on a hammock and read a book, or you can go diving or snorkeling too, if you are into it. Somewhere I yearn to re-visit every other winter-spring break. More",Mar-14

The beach has a beautiful green background of treeline and a blue sea in the foreground, if you are there with your partner you would love to spend hours together at this place. 

The place also has a changing rooms available so that would definitely let you play your heart out in the water 

You have some limited eating options available close to this place with a few bengali dhabhas offering Indian food.

The drive is also quite scenic with open fields, forests and hills. The beach is amazing with clear water. Even though large number of people visit the beach but it's still not very commercial.

The forest area near the beach adds to the credit of this location........... 

One impt thing is if you are going here on a lunch time, there are only few hotels available near the beach and here also they prepare only to order so no food will be available if you have not ordered. so before you go to the beach, order your food once your are back it will be ready.

You have to experience this and no words in my review would do a full justice to this beach. Definitely the best in A&N islands, Radhanagar beach is also voted as one of the most beautiful and clean beach in Asia. 

We visited the Radhanagar beach for 2 days in April, 2014 and stayed at a resort very close to this beach ( more of this resort in another review ) 

What we liked best : 
Very clean beach , well maintained. 
You dont get disturbed by the many hawkers you may encounter on other famous beaches. 
Enjoy the serenity with only the gentle sound of waves 
View of sunset is awesome and is a photographers delight. 
Took a bicyle from resort to the beach , thats a great experience 

What to you can take : A good camera and ofcourse beach clothes. 

What you can get back : Lovely memories and a serene mind :-) More",Apr-14

Probably the best beach in India,Spai69,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,11-Jun-14,"This is a picture postcard beach with fine white pebble-less sand & clean blue water. Some reasons are natural - but it says something about the local population & administration that they can manage to keep it as clean as they do. Mainland India has so much to learn from Havelock Island (& even Port Blair to a lesser extent) on how to keep beaches clean & conveneint for tourists. The thoughtfullness is evident in small things - liberal provision of dustbins on the beach, pay-&-use shower/change/ locker facility for beach users , nice woodland/park of huge local trees just beyond the beach with different tre species labelled, plenty of sunshades/benches , even a public use beach volleyball area. All in all -- while Radhanagar beach has some inherent natural advantages, much of it's great tourist experience is down to good upkeep. Just hope tourists like us coming from the mainland (& not used to such levels of cleanliness in public spaces) dont end up converting this lovely beach into one of those sad things that pass off as beaches in any of India's larger cities.

Beautiful and Raw,Zhirayr,"London, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,04-May-14,"The main reason why we came to Havelock Island and we were not disappointed. It's getting harder and harder these days to find a stretch of sand like this. During certain times of the day you are likely to be the one on the beach, especially early in the mornings. The water is pristine, I've tried going out as far as I could and the seabed remains pure flat white sand. This does make it uninteresting for snorkeling, although it's fun to free-dive with a mask as deep as you can so you can truly see how clear it is down there. The waves breaking near the shore are fairly sizable and make swimming fun. You can walk west all the way around Neils Cove surrounded by turquoise waters on one side and thick forest on the other. And if you're lucky you may bump into one of the resident elephants that are taken for walks regularly here. 

The east side can however get busy sometimes, although the crowd seems to remain concentrated near the entrance. I strongly urge for people to KEEP THIS BEACH CLEAN. It is truly a unique treasure of India and the Andamans. More",Apr-14

Lovely beach.....,Voyager_Nineteen71,"Pune, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,27-Apr-14,"We had heard a lot about the beach that it is arguably Asia's best and top 10 in the world, and it lived up to its rating. We went there from our resort via scooties. It is a long way from the jetty and the road is a little narrow, but it was worth the ride. The beach has the finest sand I have ever seen across any other beach...it is white, soft and almost like flour so while walking in the water, there is no fear of heels getting a little hurt esp for kids. Waters in the beach are clean, bluish green extending into bluish water in the deep. It is a long beach with the backdrop of a hill, and one of the few beaches in India with a proper setup for monitoring people in the beach with a lifeguard tower. I saw people of all ages 5 - 75 enjoying themselves in the water. The waves are really nice and one can literally wait for the next wave to jump on it. It can get a little rough for kids below 10 and so my son just decided to play towards the sand where the waves peter down a little. Shallow waters extend for quite a distance into the sea. In case one does go a little too inside, the life guards blow a whistle to call the person back into relatively shallow waters. The beach...

The beach per se is quite clean but the shower and changing rooms are just about average, though not smelly or so. One has to pay for this. Lots and lots of mosquitoes in the evening so better to avoid changing (atleast for men), put on a T shirt and go back to the hotel. There are benches with tables under trees for those who do not wish to come to the beach. Locker facilities are there but we did not use them. Anyways, it is absolutely safe as proudly said by the islanders. We kept our cameras too in the bags, taking an odd look once in a while. 

The day we went to the beach was a holiday, but inspite of the large crowd, one can enjoy the beach by going a little away from the main entrance. The beach waters have small fish so if one gets a small ant bite kind of feeling in the water, it is ok :) One can see the fishes if one observes carefully in the water. 

Sunset at the beach is pristine...a great experience. Obviously for that the sky must be clear, but given that it rains in the Andamans once in 10 days at an average, even in non rainy season, clear skies cannot be assumed. 

There are some eateries outside the main gate of the beach but it is difficult to sit there after a swim on account of the mosquitoes. 

Overall, a must visit beach at Havelock. More",Mar-14

The most amazing thing is the colour of water greenish blue, no crowd just a few people, no shops or hawkers. Just you and yours. Lovely place. This is the best rated beach of Andamans quite true but I liked Elephant Beach more than Radha Nagar Beach - though it is much bigger and lesser depth for very lengthy stretch into sea for non-swimmers. 
But at time of high tide the waves are a bit harsh and should be avoided by kids. 
A lovely lovely beach :-)",Mar-14

Touristy but stunning views,greatadventure,Bangalore,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,14-Apr-14,I wouldn't spend time here even though it carries the the weight of being 'voted the best beach in Asia'. To me any beach in Havelock can be voted as best in Asia/ world. The only difference being that the beach is thrice as wide as compared to say Beach No. 3. It is crowded with tourists but absolutely clean and there are facilities to rest and put your feet up. No swimming rings allowed so getting into the waters with little ones a no no. But do check it out if you can spare some time.,Apr-14

Good but not the Best,RounakKShah,Mumbai,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,28-Mar-14,Radhanagar Beach is indeed one of the good beaches in Havelock. The beach is very long and you would find lot of tourist venturing to this place in afternoon & evenings. The best part of the beach is the waves here are more strong when compared to other beaches in Havelock. The local administration has done a good job by building eco changing rooms and shower rooms. The biggest advantage you have is there are locker facilities available for as low as INR 10/- per hour. It is completely safe to leave behind your valuables and changing clothes in locker. Andaman is a couples destination and you would see a lot of couples in & around this beach. Overall it is a must visit attraction in Havelock. More,Feb-14

The water is clear & the waves are just addictive, there are life guards monitoring the tourist swimming in water & controlling if one is going deeper in to the sea. The sand is soft white best suited for young one to play without getting hurt.

Sunset is the crowning glory of Radha nagar beach. It is a glorious sight, when everything turns golden and the bathers retreat reluctantly, after repeated appeals by the life guards. 

Blessed with gentle waves, blue to green waters and fine sand, it has been ranked Asia’s best by Time magazine – a distinction it will soon give up, if you see the growing layer of plastic bottles accumulating on its fine sands.

There the sea bed stretches for hundreds of yards, very shallow, allowing for the water to be emerald green under the sun. White sun and Palm trees and no people make Number 5 a paradise.

The beach is very nice and one can spend long hours there. But make sure you book/order your lunch (if not carrying) beforehand in any of the street side restaurants before entering the beach area. No food is available in the beach..not even a tea stall. If any case you forget to order then there's a chance that you won't get any food. The restaurants only prepare the ordered meals.

You will feel like you are in heaven as soon as you reach here. Never have I seen a beach so pristine and beautiful. The untouched and remote location of the beaches makes it exclusive and it is a must visit. The incredible white sand, the beautiful tides, great weather, oh I fell in love with it, and I never wanted to leave. We walked along the beach and lay out in the sand and lapped up all the offerings of this divine place. The crystal clear water is such a rare sight; I was in awe of the enthralling beauty of the beach. You have to visit it to understand the sheer perfection of this beach.

"A tropical retreat, inhabited yet untouched...",theBuddha,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,08-Sep-13,"Tne presence of a luxurious resort and the absence of accessibility to normal fare, has led to a celebrated solitude to many who seek pleasant encounters with nature. 

This beach is quite some distance from the normal centre of the Havelock Island. There are very few kiosks that cater to the visitors. Accessed by a bus to commuters using public transport, this beach is worth being named what it was by the Times UK. 

The beach itself is quite long. It is opened up to a thorough fare from the parking lot, bound around by a few kiosks. The only other gate is the private opening from Barefoot resorts, also kept on guard by the stray-but-looked-after dogs. The beach at the public opening is normally crowded. Head to the right, do not get apprehensive at the sight of other traveller-groups headed from the resort (the beach is open to public!), and you will find paradise opening up, all the way till the Neil's cove, a nice tropical lagoon with turquoise blue waters and white sands. 

BUT: Please do behave sensibly to protect the environment there. Barefoot does it's part considerably well, not just for commercial interest (we took part in some cleaning programme and experienced it first-hand). This beach was regarded one of the Asia's best beaches by European standards, and let us not degrade this!

We could a cruise from Port Blair and it took us about an hour to reach Havelock. We put up in the Sea Shell resort there. Full of foreigners and natives of andamans, the place is nothing less than exotic. 

We dined at the Barefoot Scuba restaurant where we were served exquisite sea food. Delicious would be an understatement to describe the delicacies! Radhanagar beach has silver/white sand! I even got 2 bottles of sand back with me! The best bit was the sun rise, usually around 5 am and u get to see the different shades of blue. I went scuba diving and went to a depth of 50 feet on my first attempt! The world underwater is just so serene and peaceful.

Why the World calls it one of the best!,Travelling_Charu,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,20-Jun-13,"Radhanagar beach or the Beach No 7 is undoubtedly one of the most bful beaches humankind will see. The long beach is whitish and sandy and most importantly clean and silent. All you will listen is the sound of the gushing sea. I was lucky enough to stay at Barefoot resort which is the only resort on Radhanagar Beach, and its walking by, hence, it seems like you are on a personal beach. This beach is accompanied by a lightly dense stretch of tall tress giving a look of a forest or a bollywood spot for shooting a romantic song. 

The most spectacular part of visiting Radhanagar beach is viewing the sunset. I have no words.. what would you call it??... AWESOME, MOST BFUL, MESMERIZING, INTOXICATING.. and what not! I was totally taken by that sight. You can see the pics iv uploaded.

"Very good, but let's not get carried away here...",KumarRUSA,"San Francisco, California",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,15-Jun-13,"This beach is very nice, but let's not get carried away here by calling it the best in the world or even in Asia for that matter. Let's start with the positives: 1. The beach itself is not developed. This means there are no hotels, or restaurants, or hawkers, etc directly on the beach. 2. The background is stunning. This is what makes the beach very good. It's surrounded by a backdrop of thick forest/jungle. No advertisements, rickshaws honking, or any other things you can think of that would take away from the scenery and disturb the peace. 3. On the path/road leading to the beach there are numerous small restaurants/shacks selling both food and drink. I can't recall the prices but I believe they slightly inflated - not by much though. It can get very hot here so it's nice to have the option to buy refreshments. Now for the con's: 1. You can't get here by bicycle. Don't try it, you won't make it unless you're incredibly strong. 2. You have to take a bus. I have no idea of the schedule, ask the locals or your accommodation. They will know. 3. You can also rent a motorcycle/scooter and make it up here. Good if you're 1-2 people, not good for families. Pretty easy drive, not much traffic at all - road is winding and up/down hill at times. 4. There is some trash on the beach. It's...

4. There is some trash on the beach. It's not a lot of trash like you would see in say Mumbai or other parts of mainland India, however it is there. For such a mentioned place, I don't want to see a single piece of trash. Authorities need to step in and fix it up before the place is ruined. 

5. The sea is rough. Plenty of people go in the water, but be warned if you have young kids and/or inexperienced swimmers. 

6. There is a crocodile warning in one of the bays located to the north (If you enter the beach from the road, it's at the very far right end). The bay where the sign is posted is much more calm and the water very shallow/clear. Perhaps the crocs don't like the waves of Radhanagar, but be warned. I'd swim closer to groups of people rather than trying to get away from the crowd. Enjoy the sand/view away from the crowd, but not when you are in the water. 

7. You cannot snorkel here. The water is clean and a bright blue but it's murky due to some sediment. 

Overall it's a very good beach and absolutely worth a visit - probably the best one in India. But surely not the best in Asia or the world. 

I'm rating it ""Excellent"" because the bulk of tourists are Indians and for India this is as good as it gets. More",Feb-13

An ideal place to swim or enjoy your time at the shore. The wave cycles are beautiful, a long stretch of wave approaching the shore can easily be noticed. You can walk on the beach from one end to the other, options to walk by huge trees beside the beach is also an option. Don't miss to see the sunset.

The huge trees coming down to the beach were amongst the most beautiful things I have ever seen. There was also some lovely snorkelling - its not a reef but there were lots of interesting fish. When we were there we also saw a manattee or dolphin (at a distance). A fellow Barefoot traveller had seen a manatee that day when snorkelling off of the beach. Beautiful, restful days were spent on this beach - unforgettable.

To cap it all, the beach is one of the cleanest and safest in the Bay of Bengal and also has facilities for showering and changing. The month of visit should be chosen carefully to avoid the peak season crowds. 
Havelock Islands can best be reached from Port Blair by taking a luxury cruise ""Makkruz"" which provides for an awesome experience of its own. There are several excellent resorts here which offer good services at varying rates. The best time to visit is early morning to avoid the sun's wrath.

Have a bath in the crystal clear waters, have a nice sleep in the sand. The beach is different from others in a way that the other end of sand there is a line of huge trees of tropical origin. The canopy is so thick that sun rays seldom reach the floor. So underfoliage is also scarce. 

The beach has amazing Rangoli done by crab colonies. I've never seen such a thing in any other beach. They, in the process of building there underground burrows, arrange a splendid view of fashionable, usually inter connecting circles which resembles our Rangoli. 

Taking a bath in the beach is one thing not to be missed. As usual in Andamans, you can see the ocean floor. Waves are not so high and not so small too.

Add the it the lush green color of the trees.. Blue of the sky .. The blue n green shades of water... Its just picture perfect.. Its a place whr u can enjoy sun bathing and enjoy swimming. People come spp for the sunset. Its worth a watch. Also food is not a problem a there are shacks serving lunch and snacks. Though i am a vegetarian, I heard that the fish they serve is excellent n comparatively cheaper.. 
But like other places around .. Tea n coffee is prepared using milk powder only..",
Good one but overhyped,krpune,"Pune, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,01-Feb-13,"We visited the very famous Radhanagar beach and found it to be very good, but not as much as we had heard about it. The beach is comparatively clean with white sand and lots of trees around.The gradient is low which makes it ideal for swimming and hence you can really take a dip in the water here. There are some makeshift changing rooms too though not very clean. 
There are no water sports here, but you would find a cluster of shops on the road to the beach selling everything right from tea coffee to swimsuits.. 
In a nutshell, its worth visiting and watching the sunset here but we found Elephant beach and No3, No5 beaches to be much better. More",Jan-13
The best beach you can be in,Dulal777,"Barpeta, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,31-Jan-13,"The moment we landed havelock island , the first thing that came to our mind was the radhanagar beach.

The first look of the scenic blue water beach and i was like wow we are in a heavenly place. not too much crowded, clean shores, everything was just above perfect. Had a fantastic swim. good arrangement of clean water shower after swiming @ cost of 10 rs. nearby bengali road side hotels for a homely lunch was fantastic atleast to one of the group member. next day again we went to the beach. never felt like we should leave the beach. wonderfull experience.

All i missed was Chilled Beer!,Vishal_Kamat,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,31-Jan-13,"This beach is a must visit. By default it will come on anyones travel itinerary and hence i won't waste any time telling u how amazing it is. It is said ""if you want to see heaven you have to go up yourself"" ... literally translated. Hence what i will advise all is below 
1. Carry ur Own Booze. theres a wine shop in the market so carry ur Own. Its not Goa and u will get Only Coconut water 
2. Carry food. Nothing worthwhile to eat except in local joints and theres a limit to how much idli and paratha a human being can eat. this is not goa so no shacks on the beach. 
3. Please for God Sakes DONT LITTER. I'm ashamed of our Indian tourists who come there and destroy the one jewel we have left in India. 
4. please carry Booze... did i say that? oh ok so I'm emphasizing how important it is. Booze is cheap in Andamans so please support the local Wine Shop. also for those of you whisky drinkers, try this ""Vishal's Andamani Cocktail- Put one measure of Whisky in the freshly sliced Coconut water and drink till hearts delight."" 

Please enjoy this beach to the max. not one pebble to hurt you feet. not one Gutka packet floating around. No pesky vendors pimping u sarongs and cheap jewelry. 
and don't forget the booze... More",Jan-13

It's a paradise with few hotels around, small stalls in the entrance selling trashy stuff, coconut water and some food. 
Locals occupy mostly the entrance of the beach, so walk to the right and soon you'll find a spot to call yours (and probably only yours). The only thing that isn't very nice is the amount of trash that you already can see on the sand. Need dust bins. 
Bring your mask and repellent.",Dec-12

Paradise,LP1ECP,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,06-Jan-13,"One of those beaches you read about being paradise and find out it actually is. 

White sand, crystal waters and jungle trees hanging over the beach with the occasional elephant plodding along with his mahoot, the more commonly known Beach #7 is idyllic. 

The locals tend to congregate in the water at the entrance to the beach but if you stroll just a little to the left or right you will easily find a quiet spot on the sand with a tree to shade your water and belongings under. 

Turning right and walking right along to the end of the beach will find you at the lagoon which is really beautiful. There was an unfortunate and tragic crocodile attack here 3 years ago so there is often armed guards there that dont allow you to swim in the water, but when they are not there - take a dip. Dont be put off by the thought of crocs, the attack was a complete one off and the swimmers were swimming well out towards the reef. 

At the end of your day, stick around to watch the beautiful sunset with a fresh coconut sold just off the beach. 

The drive or cycle to the beach is also lovely so it really is a great day out! More",Dec-12

Utopian Setting,rvpmumbai,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,18-Nov-12,"Radhanagar is about 8 kms from the Jetty.We rented a Honda Dio and rode down the green stretch. Lazy surroundings and extremely green. No lights on the road.Carry a torch. The sunset at around 5 pm is the highlight at this beach. Shades of all colours of the sky are visible. Sand is white and the water is crystal clear and impeccably clean. Lifeguards are available. Swimming is very safe and limited from 8am to 4pm. After sunset no one is allowed into the water and the place is emptied out by the cops. No camping is allowed here. The beach is the cleanest in India for sure. There are decent changing areas for men and women with toilets. No restaurants.Only wafers and biscuits.I have yet to see a more beautiful beach in my life. It beats Langkawi clean as well. No water sportsallowed. Only the sun, the sea, the sand and the Green forests lining the beach. Family crowd, kids and lots of couples. Havelock's crown jewel is Radhanagar. I pray to God it remains the way it is. Even when its crowded, there is no rush , because its a large stretch and tourist numbers are still low in the Andamans, probably because its an expensive destination. Carry Sunblock, Sunglasses and water to drink for sure. More",Nov-12

We spent all of yesterday afternoon enjoying the water, gentle surf, gorgeous white sands that go on for kilometers. The sunset was also stunningly beautiful here. Downsides: a) little shade, unless you sit back near the tree line. b) bring your own towels/chair/shade, as nothing available here to rent. Thankfully, many vendors offer diverse things to buy in the parking lot and walk to the beach. Another option to consider is beach #5-- vijaynagar. It's also stunningly beautiful with expanse of white sandy beach and gorgeous views.

Paradise in Havelock,Claudio L,"Lanciano, Italia",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,09-Nov-12,"Havelock Before getting to this island one has to land at Port Blair where flights are arriving from Kolkota,Delhi,Chennai,etc.It wouldn’t be bad to visit the town and stay a couple of days shopping around and visiting nearby spots.

Before getting to this island one has to land at Port Blair where flights are arriving from Kolkota,Delhi,Chennai,etc.It wouldn’t be bad to visit the town and stay a couple of days shopping around and visiting nearby spots. There are many interesting ones.

I slept at the Shompen hotel from which all places of the town can be reached by foot.I choose the cheapest rooms in the third floor without A/C because in February there was no need of it at Rs. 1020 and without breakfast.Rooms are spartan,but OK.There are more expensive rooms in the first and second floor with AC at about 2.500 Rs. 
In Port Blair it’s advisable to book by a travel agency and advance payment.If you do it directly it’s possible that when you arrive the room be given to people staying longer. 
During the stay we ate at the Lighthouse restaurant where was served fish everyday. 
Of course Havelock can be reached only by boat.There is a government ferry and a private one.The first one(very cheap) needs about four hours to get to destination while the second one ” Markruzz” needs one hour and half. 
Unfortunately it’s difficult to go by normal ferry,because timetables are not widely known and one has to stand a long line in the sun to get a ticket.Sometimes when you get to the counter you are asked a photocopy or something else and you have to restart again. Probably it’s done to let people go with the other ferry. 
So many people choose the other option which costs about $ 15.00,(A/C,a comfortable seat and pleasant journey). 
At last you arrive in Havelock where you are given another permit to stay for not more than a month. When you are on the dock it starts the most difficult part of the journey if you haven’t booked an expensive hotel by travel agency. 
Cheaper accommodations are not linked to travel bureau.Anyhow ,in my opinion, one cannot book in advance without seeing the place,the distance from the village centre,the beach,etc. 
In Port Blair I met a lady who gave me few hints for the island and told me to go to the Gold Star resort at beach n.5. 
So on the dock by tuk-tuk I went there and since I was traveling with a friend and wanted two rooms it was impossible to find a second room in that location. 
So it began the odyssey by tuk-tuk to nearby resorts.I had the impression that the tuk-tuk driver knew everyone around and at last after so many inspections and getting tired we had to find a place to stay. 
The impression was that we were cornered and at last we had to pay Rs.1.600 for a bungalow worth Rs.1.300.We had no choice.They promised us a treatment (daily changing of bedsheet and towels) and we had another. They wanted to be paid in advance in order we didn’t go to another resort. 
I paid for only four days and said that I had to wait for next Monday to get money from the bank.On Monday we found a better accommodation in nearby Cross Bill resort at Rs.1.800,but since the accomodatrion was roomier,better bath-room and brick walls we were happy with the choice,because in one room could sleep comfortably two people.Of course no Breakfast. 
After that,the best thing to do is to stay one day in a resort,saying you stay more days and then go around by foot looking at the other options and choose.Nobody can demand you the payment of the days you didn’t sleep in the first hotel.Ot’s against the law. 
The first three days we attended nearby beach N.5,but it wasn’t so good because of the tide and the rocky beach.At low tide to swim I had to go far.One had to be very careful after one entered the water due to razor-edge rocks. There were a lot of stray dogs around,but they looked safe.The beach was at 20 meters from the resort and therefore was easy to reach. 
However I have remarked that most resorts are set along this beach and I saw that once a while there were pipes discharging liquids into the sea. 
After that I decided to go to beach N.7 (Radha Nagar beach)located at about 8 km. from the Havelock village.The price to go there by tuk-tuk was Rs. 300 (both ways).There is as well a bus from the village going there. 
It was fantastic!!!! The best decision I made!! We passed through beautiful green fields cultivated by Indians from the mainland. Another fantastic view was watching in the morning the children going to school! All very nice-looking ,educated,clean and orderly. 
So the remaining time in Havelock we spent it going there every day.I have no word to describe this location. One slightly misty morning we watched as well an elephant threading along towards us.Go on the web to have a right view of the place. 
At the southern part of the beach there is a fantastic lagoon where four years ago a Californian girl was killed by a stray sea crocodile.I was told that instead of leaving she got near the beast to have better shots.Anyway now the place is safe even if there is a sign warning of crocs. 
Havelock village gets into life in the evening with shops and the marketplace where the island produce is sold.At 9 p.m. life ends and the only option is to go back home. 
Most of the shops are concentrated there. 
Most tourists are young. Hygiene in most restaurants is not much high due to lack of running water in many places; however in India do like the Indians.We ate a lot of fresh fish at the restaurant beside the Marketplace and the temple. 
People are simple and very good hearted.Great dignity in poverty!We should learn! 
As far as money changing is concerned there are difficulties.An Israeli guy had to go back to Port Blair to change his travelers cheques.In the village there are three banks.One is only for local, in the second you cannot draw more than 1000 Rs. at a time. In the third bank one could change money,but ATM is not always working. So you resort to change banknotes, but this can be done only between 11.00-12.00 a.m.I don’t know why! 
I went at that time and I found out that no change could be carried out,because they had not received currency values from Delhi.I went next day and the director told me that they couldn’t change money that day.In the meantime I saw that another European before me had performed the operation.Then the director saw my face and that I was about to go to police,he obliged. 
One could change money at the supermarket with a loss of about 10%.That’s all! 
The only hindrance in the Andamans is the excess of burocracy.Whatever operation we had to perform(change,tickets buying,hotel booking)we had to produce copy of passports and various permits. 
I’ll go back to the Andamans,anyway! More",Feb-12

Most people enter the beach from the main road and enjoy there and go back. But the real surprise is the beach next to this one. It's the Neil's Cove. In fact it's the most beautiful beach that I have ever seen. To see Neil's cove walk till the west end of the beach till you hit the rocks. Then climb over them to see something amazing.

Best beach I have seen,asokadas,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,05-Jul-12,"We went to Radhanagar Beach at about 8.30 in the morning. The usual crowd had not come. We went early since we had a snorkeling appointment at 11.30. This beach is outstanding. I hail from Puri, Orissa. Puri beach is one of the most brilliant beach to me. But, Radhanagar took my breath away. Huge expanse, clean and white sand, green and cean environment, the majestic view of the ocean and waves takes you to another land. I had my money's worth there. There are beautiful open huts with benches to sit and stare at the vast sea. Terrific green and red tender cocunuts. All are very careful not to litter the beach. The vendor carries a litter can to take away disposals. 
We spend two-three hours in the sea, looking at it and marvelling about the natural panaroma that our country offers. Came back with great memories. More",Jun-12

I visited Radhanagar Beach as part of a Make May Trip tour package that i took to Radhanagar Beach. 

It was one of t he best attractions of the Whole Andamans Trip. Its a Sunset beach (that's what the people said). Its very beautiful and the beach is very shallow to quite some distance so is also a very safe beach. The sand is so white and water is so clear. You can play various beach games as the beach is so clean and plain. 

Life guards are available till 4 PM so safe till then. 

For honeymooners its like the best thing.",Jun-12

Bliss of Nature,Sulagna_Das,"Noida, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,30-Mar-12,"Best beach I have ever seen:-) 

If you want to go and do some proper swimming, Radha Nagar is the place to head for. While beautiful, most of the other beaches have very shallow, coral-filled waters, but Radha Nagar shelves off quite quickly, so is the perfect depth, and even gets some pretty big waves if you fancy body-boarding or surfing. You'd have to bring your own equipment for that though, as there's none in any of the shops on Havelock. 

There are a couple of beach hut and cabin 'hotels' right next to Radha Nagar, but they're pricier than many of the others on the island, and a long way from the main village. You're better off doing what we did - staying closer to the village / harbour area, and renting a scooter to get to No 7 and and other beaches. There are buses running on the island too, but I don't know how frequently they go or how much they cost. 

There's a small line of shops and cafes at the entrance to the beach where you can get snacks, cups of tea, meals and even books! and the most special thing is the Red Coconut.....jst awsm!! More",Dec-11

A very good beach but haphazardly maintained. Andaman Administration, a body under the direct control of Government of India is in charge of the maintenance. They do their job on days when a Bureaucrat or politician of some status visits these beaches. Rest rooms are opened to them. If you know a relative of a relative of a Senior bureaucrat and want to visit Radhanagar beach, facilities will be available to you in style in Government properties. If not just hang around under a rickety palm leaf umbrella, take a few pictures and get lost. There is no decent toilet facilities and open air seems to be the order for general visitors.

There are no hawkers or touts in the area. The beach is clean with no debris. The water is crystal clear and not a lot of waves, so absolutely safe for people to wade in even if they don't know how to swim. There is a place on the beach where you can rent some rubber tubes that can be used if you don't know how to swim. You will notice a huge crowd swimming at one place when you approach the beach from the road. Don't know why people do that. Move away from them towards the right and you can stay away from someone accidentally banging into you, while swimming. 
Changing Rooms Tip: There are some changing huts near the beach, but they don't have a shower and they are very dirty. Ask the tube rental fellow where the pay and use change rooms are. They are about 100 yards towards Barefoot and you can use the shower and change for INR 10/-.

incredible,global_pilgrim,"Adelaide, Australia",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,07-Jan-12,"The water is crystal clear. The sand is soft, and gently sweeps into the sea. The waves are small and far between. And the beach stretches for a couple of kilometers. This is Heaven on earth! 

We have visited in 2009 and 2011. Curiosly on both trips the India tourists all swim in one spot in the middle of the beach, and foreigners spread out on either side. It's a great arrangement because you can end up with a stretch of beach all to yourself. The quietest time is in the early morning, but it's never really too crowded. Tourist numbers are increasing on Havelock, so we'll see if that changes. More",Jan-12

A beach to remember,BhaskarShakhi,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,04-Nov-11,"Tips: 
Book tickets to and fro in the cruise ship (Ramanuja) a day before the journey. 

Reach Port before sunrise to take the cruise ship. Its a 4-4.30hr journey.. It will reach Havelock Island around 10. 

Hire a Jeep from there to show you the beaches. Make sure they cover Radha Nagar Beach.. That’s the most beautiful one. Don’t try to take bath there or you may miss other attractions near by. 

Make sure to return to port by 1 pm.. Have lunch at local hotels near the port. Catch the ship for going back to Port Blair. 

If you have time, you may stay back at Havelock for a night.. There are tents available over the beach.. Indeed an exciting stay .. More",Mar-11

Easily one of the most serene beaches in India,bpbindaas,"Melbourne, Australia",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,05-Mar-11,"Radhanagar beach, or beach no.7 is the main beach on Havelock Island. 
I visited Havelock in Feb 2011 and was happy to see that this place had lived to the rave reviews from my friends. 
The water is brilliant- pristine and blue and the sand is really fine. Although, I would say that the Kalapathar beach on the island has more hues of blue. 
The best part is the lack of crowds that you tend to find in beaches in India (and almost everywhere for that matter). 
You have to visit Radhanagar beach and Havelock if you travel to Andamans!",Feb-11

By far the best beach I have seen!,Archeogal,"Melbourne, Australia",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-Dec-10,"Radha Nagar beach in Havelock Island is one of the best beaches I have seen in my life! I thought it was going to be like any other beach but I was surprised when I reached the spot! It is a very neatly maintained blue color paradise on earth! We spent half a day in this beach and enjoyed every moment there! By the evening, it started raining and there was a ship travelling in the sea, it was the best view of life! Its a quiet beach with white sands. You can take a walk with the beach on one side and beautiful huge trees on the other! There is a resort located right on the beach. The only minus is that there are no restaurants close by. You will have to eat in the resort, there wont be much choice with food. Radha Nagar beach is a hidden treasure and nobody is aware of it! I would recommend you to visit this beach if you plan a trip to Andaman. Havelock Island is reachable through a one hour cruise from Port blair. It is a must visit place! More",
Simply Gorgeous,solewalker,"Seattle, Washington",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,30-Jun-10,"Redhanagar Beach is a surreal experience - while walking on it, on my left ear, I could hear the sound of waves gently splashing against the beach, and on my right ear, I could hear bird song from the forest. Simply the best of both worlds. The clear, turquoise water also makes a beautiful juxtaposition with the white, sandy beach. There is also some snorkeling, for anyone who wants to swim with the fishes. 

Best of all? Very few tourists.",
Unbelievably picturesque,Badal D,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,30-Dec-09,"One of the best beaches in the world etc., but let me tell you, Radhanagar is also a fairy tale scene brought to life. Unbelievably picturesque, flawlessly astonishing disclosure of nature’s splendour can be experienced here. 

Heavenly peace has dominated the place. There's pin-drop silence for a moment, and there comes a well-mannered wave, 5km long, gently splashing in a beautiful accord, and there's complete silence again till the next one. This splash is the only thing you can hear on the beach. 

Lush Mahua trees surround the beach, high-spirited, standing tall, as if touching the clouds. You get into the forest and you can't see the sky. Suddenly emerges an elephant out of the trees, which you can ride for 20 rupees! 

Best time to be there is around 7 am. And you have enough stories to tell your kids and grand-kids. More",

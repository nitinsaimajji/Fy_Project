Though it was cloudy, the sunset was worth seeing.. going behind clouds and then emerging as a round ball of orange. It was amazing. The beach is clean, sandy and it is wonderful to enjoy a walk on the seaside. 
Moreover, the small shops selling knickknacks on the sea shore were very tourist friendly.

Must visit,Devendra G,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,29-Mar-19,"Firstly, there are two different Laxmanpur beach, No.1 and No. 2. Both beaches are a must visit. Now focusing on each of the beaches: 

Beach number 2 is were Howrah bridge and other natural rock formations can be seen. The beach has both live coral and dead coral. You must visit the beach along with a guide which you would easily get outside the beach. The guide would tell you the property of all the variety of corals and sea creatures which are easily visible on the rocky beach due to low tide. Beach number 2 is a must visit and is very different from any other beach in andaman islands.

CLEAN serene beach with unsticky sand.,Rengi R,"Goa, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,23-Feb-19,"A veryvery silent beach on Neil Island is Laxmanpur Beach that is outshining every other beach on the island in terms of beauty and ravishing charm. Among the beaches in Andaman, i would rank this among the top 4 and the major reason for that is the greatest combination of bluish greenish water, the long stretch of secluded beach, the tropical trees in the backdrop , white unskicty sand [ yes, am a huuge fan of unskitcky sand] and the heaven-like peace prevailing around. We stayed at tango resort which is bang on the beach. 

Just walk along the beach and it will let you marvel at the beauty of the surrounding in a deep manner and the natural spectacle would enable you to revel in and linger the vacation you have planned to have over here.

In the early morning 5.30 to 8 am the beach was full of water due to high tide while when I saw in the late morning around 10 am, water had receded due to low tide and lots of corals were bare on the beach.

Nice beach,guptaeti,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,17-Nov-18,"• Visited with a group of friends of 13 people. 
• The point of disembarkment is still under construction. So, you might face a little inconvenience at boarding and alighting. 
• The way luggage is managed( rather mismanaged) , is pretty much pathetic. But that's an integrated part of travelling by Ferries in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, irrespective of where you're going and which ferry or class you're taking. 
• Just a day trip is sufficient as per my experience, if possible. 
• Only 2G works here. No phone connectivity. Only BSNL is functional and sometimes Vodafone, if you are lucky enough. 
• We visited the natural coral bridge at Lakshmanpur Beach II. The hike to the bridge itself was an excellent experience. 
• Also went to the Bharatpur Beach for Glass bottom Boat ride and the weather initially was scorching hot. But became very pleasant after the rain. 
• Carry a pair of change to the beach, if you intend to take sea bath and an umbrella or a hat. More",Nov-18
GREAT PLACE TO WATCH THE SUNSET AT NEIL ISLAND,chow69,"Bhopal, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,17-Nov-18,"Also known as Laxmanpur I, this is the place to watch the sunset at Neil Island. We were a bit late to reach here from Laxmanpur II after seeing Howrah Bridge, so the sun was well down. However the beach was extremely active. An extremely scenic beach, it is very akin to Radhanagar in Havelock, but not as clean. A great many shacks are at the beach entrance thereby making it extremely crowded to get onto the beach proper. We hung on till it was nice and dark and saw a ship leaving the harbour and its lights disappearing into the deep sea. The beach closes by 5 pm or thereof, so it is recommended that one reaches it by 3 pm to have an hour of swimming before the sun sets. More",Nov-18

Clean and Serene,Photosynthetix,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,12-Feb-15,"Undoubtedly, Laxmanpur beach in Neil Island is one of the most beautiful beach in Andaman after Radhanagar. Just about an hour’s ferry ride from Havelock island, it’s a must see in the Andaman travellers’ itinerary. From there we went to Laxmanpur Beach, about 15 minutes drive. The beach is very safe for bathing. However, the seabed is full or coral which makes it difficult to walk on the rough surface. There are beautiful sculptural coral lying everywhere in the beach but as per laws of the land one cannot collect them and leave Andaman. All the corals needs to be declared and left behind in the Airport, unless it is purchased (receipt to be shown). The beach is clean. the horizon is a magnificent culmination of various shades of blue, playing with soft white clouds. An awesome place for landscape photography to bring out the ultra wide angle lenses. We had a delicious Bengali lunch at the hotel abutting the beach, with Rosogollas in dessert! This was the last island we visited in Andaman, and it really was a grand finale to our tour. Unfortunately we had to leave before the sunset, so we missed the rendezvous of the dusk. More",Jan-15

Meals n variety on jet airways too spicy n boring.not very tasty just edible. 
Staff on jet very courteous n helpful. 
Andaman airport staff see too many tourists perhaps.just apathetic indifference in general.Notices everywhere should just clearly say one cannot carry back any dead shell or dead coral collected on beaches.

Clean Clear Composed,BhavikMody,"Jodhpur, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,16-May-14,"Laxmanpur Beach is the longest beach on Neil Island. A beach that starts from the Neil Jetty and extends far off till your eyes can see. It's white sand with the blue and green waters in the backdrop give a nice visual throughout the day. A distant view of the big brother Havelock Island is also a treat. The beach is followed by a coral bed before the sea takes over. One end of the beach i.e. towards the jetty has a mangrove thicket which is a treat to watch and of course a place to have a walk in if you are a wildlife enthusiast. The mangrove habitat is varied and mesmerizing. The other end of the beach is green forest of huge trees and this is the very famous sunset point of Neil Island. Truly the sunset from this point is magnificent and picturesque. 

What more can I say? Laxmanpur beach is special to me as my resort was located on this beach so had a lot of fun on this beach. And yes one of my best memories of life is having a romantic candle light dinner on Laxmanpur Beach with the subtle sea at my feet and beautiful yellow moon in the star studded sky...an experience of lifetime.

A beach to view the sun set..,aranhaag,"Pune, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,09-Dec-13,"Located at 2 kms. from Neil Island Jetty, this beach is well known as the sun set point. The only road from jetty to laxmanpur beach houses some of the resorts like Sea Shell, Tango Beach Resort and Pearl Park beach resort. 
From Tango Beach Resort to the sun set point, a small stretch of the road is bumpy. 
Once you reach the beach, you have to walk some distance on the beach to witness the sunset. Generally tourists are seen flocking this beach at sun set time which is between 4.30 p.m. to 4.45 p.m. in the first week of December. 

This beach is surrounded by huge trees on one side. The white sandy beach filled with dead rocky corals is the best spot to sit and watch the sun set. It is not ideal for swimming on account of rocky dead corals. The water is crystal clear and you can clearly see the corals and stones inside the water. 
Except for a small road side tea vendor, nothing else is available to eat or drink on the beach. More",Dec-13
Beautiful,Apurba20,"Raipur, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,11-Nov-13,"People throng to this beach in the afternoon, to get a peek of the sunset. There are two beaches 1 and 2, but it is the former which is more popular. One of the best beaches in Neil, this has a wide expanse of white sand and it is not only wonderful to get magnificent sunset views but also to walk on the stretch of the beach. There is a shingara (samosa) wala too who sells great shingara.",Nov-13

The beach is highly stony and dangerous rocks are there on beach which are slippery and dangerous.

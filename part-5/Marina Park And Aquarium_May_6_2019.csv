WORTH A VISIT: AREA NEEDS TO BE CLEANED,chow69,"Bhopal, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,13-Nov-18,"Visited this place twice when we were in Port Blair recently. This particular park is made on reclaimed land, which is supposed to have been reclaimed by dumping the extra soil got from the evacuation for the construction of the Cellular Jail. The area has been done beautifully and is adjacent to the Rajiv Gandhi Water Sports Complex, the Andaman Water Sports Complex and the Netaji Subhash Bose Stadium. 
In and around the Marina Park is the Statue of Netaji Subhash Chander Bose, the PVC Memorial, the Tsunami Memorial, the Aberdeen Memorial (In honour of the battle of Aberdeen, between the Great Andamanese and the Brits). Unfortunately all the memorials and the area around them need to be maintained and cleaned. The sorry state of the PVC Memorial and the Netaji Memorial is primarily because of people littering the place and sitting all over the memorials. The Army has placed a tank close to the Netaji Memorial. 
There is a clear view of Ross Island visible from this Park. The Marine Aquarium is closer to the Cellular Jail and has a good collection of fish, corals and skeletons of sea creatures. Unfortunately the same is poorly maintained. More",Nov-18
Lot of Specimens,som71cal,India,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,30-Oct-18,"Fisheries Department's Aquarium is located by the side of Water Sports Complex and closed on Wednesday. The daily lunch time is from 1300 hrs to 1400 hrs. Museum has decent specimens of dead marine funa. However, it's 'live aquarium part' is badly managed with sub-optimal collection of live marine fishes. Infact, the aquarium part of Samudrika Naval Museum is far superior then this place. There's a small souvenir shop run by a local self help group at its main Entrance Door; where one can find various gift items made of sea shells. This outlet is one of the cheapest selling joint of such product in Port Blair. Infact, cost of similar items are cheaper here than Government controlled ""Sagarika"" Selling Outlet. Ofcourse, to get the optimum price one has to use his/her 'Bargaining' skill upto the hilt. Overall, it is worth spending half hour at this Aquarium of Department of Fisheries. More",Oct-18

Don't go to this one,rajatmaheshwari,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,28-Jun-14,"It's a waste of time. Who would like to see Fishes and other animals in Formaldehyde bottles. It took just 5 mins to come out of this one. If your tour itinerary has it, get it changed.",Mar-14

Aquarium Port Blair,MGOSWAMI,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,11-May-14,A good collection of Andaman marine biota is exhibited here in a scientific way.

poor cousin to samudrika,gypsy23097,"Ko Samui, Thailand",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,18-Apr-14,"if you are planning to make a trip to the naval samudrika museum, you can easily skip this. although entry fee is nominal, the display is second grade as compared to the other. both in terms of variety and style. however, if you are trying to finish port blair in a day and wish to save time then being close to both the cellular jail & the jetty used for ross island visits, this will prove a quicker bet.",Mar-14
Lots of fish!,brajendraprasad,"Hyderabad, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,08-Apr-14,"Fisheries museum has a few dead and a few live fishes. I'm not a good reviewer for fish - but I can tell you it has a sperm whale skeleton at the entrance, is on one single floor and is located close to the water sports complex. A large hall houses aquariums, and one more houses dead things preserved in formaldehyde inside bottles. The aquariums are not large enough to have any large fishes - say 4/5 feet across. Worth a visit, if you're close by or alternatively, if you're crazy about fish.",Apr-14
"Horrible, depressing, please avoid",Namitha_Arvind,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,07-Apr-14,"Going by the name, we assumed that this was an ""aquarium"", with lot of sea-animals and marine life. It turned out to be a depressing formalin lab. The marine animals are stuffed into jars filled with formalin. As a result, they have all lost color and have acquired a ghostly look. Very depressing place and certainly not what is expected from an ""Aquarium"". Please avoid!",Apr-14

OK.,jai_family_traveller,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,28-Jan-14,You get to see sea flora fauna. Its good for children provided they have interest and willing to listen,Jan-14
Poorly maintained,iFlex,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,20-Jan-14,"Entry gate says its an aquarium, but all you will see is formalin-preserved fishes that are wrongly identified. Don't Andaman Fisheries Dept have some fish taxonomists? Seaweeds are all wrong too, and funniest part is that the labels of bottle covers the entire bottle so that no one can see contents inside. One bottle reads ""Halimeda"" and describes full taxonomic hierarchy and the label covers everything except a small portion in the botton where you will see a white liquid! Actual halimeda is golden brown fan like, one of the prettiest seaweeds, but this museum will make you hate all aquatic life. Terrible experience, please dont go there to hate marine biology!

Go to samudrika instead,Snehalkanodia,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,10-Jan-14,the fisheries museum is not worth your time. the items on exhibit are similar to that in samudrika. The rest seems like a science lab.,Dec-13

Just too small,Jean-MarcS,France,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,05-Nov-13,This aquarium is a nice attempt to bring the public attention to sea life.

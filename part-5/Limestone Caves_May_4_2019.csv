Really eco friendly surroundings. On reaching There is wooden erected platforms to enable tourists to cross over Mangroves and reach the land. About 1.5KM walk is really worth once you reach the Limestone caves. This is naturally formed Caves and there are lime formations which is unique and really amazing.

Superb,ms14_delhi,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,12-Mar-19,The long journey to baratang that starts at 3 in the mornings is worth the pain of the travel passing the reserved forests of Jarawa tribes on the way the gates of which open only at regulated tons few times a day. The road journey is followed by a public ferry then private motor boat through the mangroves followed by a trek. The natural caves with a variety of naturally formed figures are a delight,Mar-19
Baratang Trip,KapoorSakshi,"Noida, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,01-Mar-19,Limestone caves have deteriorated and hardly any left to view. The boat ride ad investing 1 complete day is not worth it for the place . Though the mangrove forest boat ride will be good and gazing at the river side you might spot a crocodile. The guides will rush you through the trip. This area is too warm due to special trees around so make sure to carry your cap and sun creams along.,Jan-19

Pretty much a journey worth remembering,SambeetM4,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,09-Feb-19,"A visit to Limestone Caves located in Baratang Island is one of its kind . The journey is worth it . You have to start at 2 am at night from Port Blair in order to reach the checkpost . After obtaining the permit , you need to go through Jarawa tribal forest area to reach Bartang Pier . From there you will have to take a boat to reach the Limestone caves. 

Limestone caves have naturally forming Limestone figures of different shapes and sizes.

Once that is sorted, you board a boat to reach the Baratang caves. Just pray for the sea to be calm or your trip may get cancelled! 

And then you walk through the mangroves to reach the beautiful caves. Do carry a good torch. Mobile light is not sufficient specially when you have kids along. Let your boat guide show you around! Different shapes formed by itself over decades! And a small hole from top for some light and air! 

Once you are done, walk back to your boat through the mangroves!

Dangerous to go there without protection,GuruGhummakad,"Faridabad, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,25-Sep-18,"We were travelling with a friend from Forest Department and were lucky to get a boat to visit Limestone Caves around 3 pm. The motor boat ride from Baratang Jetty to the point near Limestone caves was approx 30 minutes. When we landed there, it started to drizzle which gradually increased to normal rain. The most part of the walkway from the point of disembarkation till the caves is not paved and rains made it slushy and very slippery. I slipped at a point and injured my face and hand, falling on the ground. We expected this to be a world class caves structure and a tourist attraction but unfortunately it was not like that. There were no proper footpaths, no lighting arrangement inside the caves, no one to guide us and on top of that we were not wearing gum boots, were struck by leeches. My friend's daughter showed us a snake too. Area near the shore had a board, indicating presence of crocodiles. Considering all these dangers, it is a must to be fully prepared for a jungle adventure before coming to this place, which was not indicated anywhere at the starting point.

You need to catch the cab really early morning (around 2:30) in order to be a part of convoy which crosses the tribal area around 6 am. The best part of the journey was seeing a few jarava tribes on way to baratang. It was so fascinating to get a glimpse of the tribal india. Limestone caves reminded me of geography classes (stalactites and stalagmites). But didn't find them exceptional as the journey was very long hectic and tiring. 
We also saw mud volcanoes but again they were just okay. Overall it was just the glimpses of jarawa tribes which made the journey worth while. Our driver played an important part as he entertained us with stories of encounter with the tribes.

Requires, 

Drive from Port Blair -> 
Jurkatang (wait till 6 AM for check-post to open) -> 
Drive through Jarawa reserve forest (no photos, spot Jarawa tribe people) -> 
Take a Ferry to cross the water -> 
Reach Baratang island -> 
Take permit and board speedboat to ride through mangroves -> 
Reach the trekking spot (walk for 1.2.KM) through villages -> 
Reach Lime Stone Caves 

Start early to reach the check-post as vehicles need to go in the convoy in the Jarawa reserve. If you are early, you are front in the queue of the convoy. 

No photos in Jarawa reserved area. You can spot few Jarawas if you are lucky. 
May not expect all Jarawas to be in traditional costumes as forest dept started distributing them the food and clothing. 

Carry enough water, as the journey can be tiring as the road is not very good, hot and you will not get anything during your journey through Jarawa reserve. 

You are not supposed to eat during the trip in Jarawa reserve, so plan to eat early or after crossing the reserve. More",May-18

After reaching Baratang, one has to hire a speedboat for the caves. Takes around 20-25 minutes to reach the jetty amidst mangroves where one disembarks.

Use lots of sunscreen as the sun really is HOT. 

The washroom facilities etc are rudimentary. Although There are small shacks selling lemonade near the entrance to the caves, no hotel/ restaurant nearby. 

The caves are narrow and dark. The guides available there take groups of tourists and explain about the caves. They carry LED lights for visibility. 

The stalactites in the caves have been formed by centuries of seepage of water under the forest. Their natural shapes are fascinating and include shapes like lotus, conch shell, shiva, chandelier etc....One has to spend time exploring the ceiling and the walls to enjoy the beauty.The caves are definitely worth visiting if one doesn’t mind walking.

Saw people struggling to get into the massive ferries .. but we waited for the 4th trip and bingo !!! the vessel came back and there were only 5 -10 people on board with few trucks. We went straight to the the captains cabin area and the view was the best..

The trip gives you an opportunity to observe people who are apart from all others. But at cost of what ? Our driver was beaten by small jarwa kid who wanted tobacco when the car had slowed down due to traffic in the convoy.. we are the reason for their illness and these needs. 

Apart from the humanitarian angle, we saw jarawa man with his kill of a wild boar at his back, kids with sharp things meant for fishing, women carrying kids on our way. Very long ride, very rainy ride. 

Mud volcano is fantastic, trip to it is even more.. We had some fresh Coconuts out here, the very best ever and tremendously huge. 

Speed boat ride in rain to mangrove forest was once in a life experience and thrilling ! It was however, very difficult to walk from the jetty till caves with atleast one fall for each member of my family in the muddy path via jungle. 

Caves are not to be missed - pictures say it all. Entire trip is worth a visit without fail. I just hope we can stop on passing by from the endangered tribes.

The reason being to be on the top of the queue. 
Only the first 200 vehicles are allowed as you need to go via the tribal area 
No stopping. No open windows as the tribes at times may be fierce. 
The taxi reaches the check point by 4.30 or so.. The gate opens only by 6.00.the place is teeming wid tea tiffin shops.. And restrooms are also avlble.. 
The journey thru the forest was so scenic.. After abt one and half hours journey, you reach the backwaters 
You need to take the ferry which plies regularly to the other bank which is Baratang. 

From there, speed boats take you through the scenic mangrove forests to the lime stone caves. Rs. 800 per person. Once you get down, there is a trek on flat surface for abt one kms. 
The caves was worth every penny of trouble. After rerurning to Baratang, we wanted to visit the live mud volcanoes. Its abt 20minutes ride in the jeep. The mud volcano area is barricaded and looked like small cement mounds. But bubbling.. 
Never seen a live volcano 

Then the return journey across the ocean, through the jawar tribal area and back to portblair started. Reached hotel by 4.30.seeing the tribes was a bonus.

I looked at the trip as an wholesome experience that consisted of 

1. Journey through the Jarava reserve forest while flora and fauna that I don't think I have seen elsewhere. There is certain uniqueness though I am not any specialist, I found the trees different and of-course the forest was really dense. 
2. Journey in the speed boat through the mangroove forests that is unspoiled and beautiful. You needed to duck to avoid the branches at some places. 
3. The lime stone caves themselves - They have their own character and uniqueness. I have seem Belum caves and Borra caves in Andhra Pradesh, India. These are different from them and have their own charm. 

You should consider this as an entire package and visit - else you will find the journey too arduous for just the limestone caves. More",Jan-18

The journey by small ferry to limestone cave entrance through mangrove forest is awesome and scenic . From small jetty limestone cave is a 4km walk up and down . It goes through partial forest. If you are going in rainy season carry rain coats n wear slippers. Also carry a Torch to see the caves properly as they are dark. Some of the guides do carry torch though. We prepared to walk and enjoy this experience. If you can't walk you will not be able to enjoy. 

Lime stone cave is a marvel of nature and it's Amazing how god formed them. As you go deep inside the caves it becomes so intriguing. Surely more than talking it's something to go there and experience. 

Other than that there is a mangrove walk there. Dnt miss it there is walking path built through the mangrove forests and it's amazing. We went in the rains and it feels even better. 

The overall experience of the jungle coming to baratang , taking the steamer to cross the mangrove and the travel ferry to visit the lime stone caves is one of the most unique experiences across the globe. It might not have e flares of good hotels and eateries but it's and experience to being with nature and having etables from small stalls makes it so different and so enthralling.

And it was more so for us because it was pouring that day. To reach the limestone caves of the Baratang Islands we had use different modes of transport and travel through different zones. 

Early in the morning our car took us to the jetty very close to the hotel from where the ferry to Bambbo Flat island would be leaving. We boarded the ferry along with the car. There were other cars on the ferry too, along with two-wheelers and general passengers. On reaching Bamboo Flat island in about 10 minutes, we drove on to reach Jirkatang. Jiraktang has tea shops serving hot breakfast and there are reasonably clean public toilets which one can use before staring their onward journey. 

The next stretch of the Andaman Trunk Road (ATR) passes through the Jarawa reserve. From Jirkatang we joined the convoy of cars, with police cars leading and tailing the convoy, for our onward journey to the Middle Strait jetty. This convoy goes up and down four times a day and the timings are rigid. We came across some members of the Jarawa community during this journey. 

On reaching the Middle Strait jetty we took another ferry to reach the Baratang Island. This time the car did not accompany us. On one side of this jetty we saw elephants pushing lumber along the sea bed. That particular day was very rainy and on reaching Baratang Island we were in two minds about whether we should take the risk of traveling in the rains in an open motorized boat to see the limestone caves. However, we finally decided to go and took a 10 minute journey in a high speed boat to reach the island where the limestone caves are located. This journey through the sea was something I'll always remember. The rain was lashing against our faces like pin-pricks, the boat was bouncing against the waves and it seemed it was landing on boulders each time it bounced; we were hanging on to the boat for our dear lives but the boatman was as cool as ever and kept reassuring us that the sea was okay and not at all dangerous. It was scary but fun. 

The rain subsided a little after a while. As we approached the island we passed through mangrove creeks and suddenly another world opened up before our eyes. It was amazing to see a mangrove forest from so close. On reaching the island we had to walk a 1.5 km slippery stretch through the forest and many of the travelers were slipping and falling on the muddy forest floor. What I realized during my trip to the Andamans is that a light, hooded raincoat and good quality floaters are must-haves along with light easy to dry clothes. 

The actual limestone caves do not occupy a very large area. There are some very interesting shapes the stalactites and stalagmites have formed. The boatmen act as guides and carry lights with them to show the insides. A very interesting culmination to an exciting journey! 

We went back the same way we came. One must be very careful about the timings because neither the ferry back nor the convoy will budge from their scheduled departure times. one couple missed the ferry as they came running along the shore. On the way back we met some more Jarawa people. Three young Jarawa boys stopped our car and asked us for paan (betel leaf). Of course, we could not oblige. We did not have any on us and offering them food, or taking their pictures are strictly prohibited. Because it seems their immunity system is just not made to tackle food we urban people eat. 

The day was hectic but an eventful one. I would highly recommend a visit to these caves to anyone visiting the Anadamans. More",Sep-17

Dont get me wrong here. 3 stars are for the overall experience. The limestone caves are beautiful, but the entire to and fro is extremely hectic. Heres my point to point review for Limestone Caves 

1. We woke up at 2 am! Yes 2 am to take the renter car with a driver for Rs.4500/- for the day; we left for Baratang at 3 am. 

2. The reason for leaving at 3 am is logical though. You will see a convoy forming as you head towards the adivasi area or specifically known as thw Jarwa tribe reserve. You; as in your car will try and become a part of the first convoy which registers at the checkpoint and leave at 6 am sharp. In order to cover the distance and hold your spot you must leave at 3 and reach the checkpoint by 4:30am. We were number 32 in a convoy of 106 cars/vehicles 

3. Before the convoy is allowed to pass, you are required to fill up some documents with identity proof. These documents are normally submitted by your driver to the forest official while you wait for the clock to strike 6. The acceptance means you will be allowed to go through. 

4. The convoy moves at a speed of 40kmph and does not stop. No car is allowed to stop since it is a tribal reserve. We were lucky enough to spot some jarwas but we obeyed the rules and did not click any pictures. The tribe is on the road of civilization though; they wear clothes just like the urban population while minutely expressing the culture of their tribe. 

5. After about an hour and a half, we reached a jetty. Our driver was superb. He hurried us off on the ferry and then brought the car on the ferry too! This ferry ride is about 10 mins long and is Rs8/- per person. Once you get off the ferry, run towards the permit counter and get yours to get on the boat to baratang island. This permit is free of cost. And one person can check in upto a group of 10. So choose the fastest in your group to line up. 

6. You then get on a speedboat. The speedboat then takes you to the island where the limestone caves are. The ride is fun and about 35 mins long and Rs.600/- and includes guide services per person. Once you get down from the speed boat; you have to walk about 1.7 kms to get to the limestone caves. This is where its gets really tiring for old people. People with mobility issues have a tough time. Imagine coming all this way and not being able to see the caves; and therefore you should think if its worth risking their health. They can sit at a middle point and wait for you if they dont want to walk. 

7. The Limestone caves are a marvel. But with humans touching the walls and the heat, the pure white shimmering white walls have turned black. But if you spend a quite moment in there you will realize how marvellous nature is. There is a rush at all times as the speedboat operators try and get as many runs as possible. 

8. You return via speedboat and then take a jeep ride to the mud volcano. It was a very hot day and we could have easily given the mud volcano a miss; but the curiosity got the bette of us and we did end up going. Our driver who had brought the car over the ferry saved us Rs. 300/- which is he the fare for hiring the jeep to mud volcano. 

9. The same ferry ride back and the same convoy system will get you back to Andaman- Port Blair at about 4 pm in the evening. 

10. On your way back stop by the market to indulge in some souvenir shopping or spend some time at the marine drive and enjoy the evening breeze. You will surely sleep like a baby after this trip to Baratang. More",Mar-17

At Middle Strait, it is interesting to note how buses/vehicles alight and board on the ferry to reach either side of the middle strait. 

Though the journey up to Middle Strait was tedious, but the tediousness vanished when we saw a rare scene, ie. the entry of bus & cars on the deck of the ferry, and it was thrilling. There is a separate space reserved for the passengers on ticket basis. We got down at Nilambur Jetty and took a speed boat, which accommodates 6 persons to the lime stone cave. The trip is very adventurous and at the same time very dangerous also, but we were provided with life jackets. The boatman accompanied us like a guide with a powerful electronic torch light. The vast expanse of the mangrove forests on the waterline was a relish to the eyes.. But the speedboat trip was more than one hour, and it was terrifying whenever the boat faced a wave – akin to a road travel with lots of pot-holes. Such is the experience when we faced every ripple on the sea. Finally we reached a small jetty, and from where, we proceeded to the Limestone Cave, which was weathered by rains, many a storm and tsunamis. As a result of these natural phenomena, the limestone cave is taking different shapes, and the visitors attribute it to their whims and fancies. The return trip was also thrilling, fearful and awesome. At Baratang, at AR Restaurant we had our lunch. Again, from Nilambur jetty to Middle Strait, by a ferry and from Middle Strait, we travelled by bus. The entire road is in the reserve forest, and we were fortunate to see two Jarawa women carrying logs of wood. On the whole, the trip to Baratang was very interesting. More",Feb-17

Not too many stalactites ... and no stalagmites worthy of the name, and a narrow viewing hall which if crowded will spoil the entire experience. 
If part of your itinerary, be sure to tell your travel agent to ensure that you are there in the first convoy across the forest, and not the 9 AM convoy … this will ensure that you don’t have to rush thru the caves.

It's a 30-40 mins journey by speed boat from the Baratang Jetty to the caves and it offers you very beautiful scenery; One that's generally seen in the movies. The trip to Baratang is a whole day trip so plan in advance as you need to leave by 4 am from Port Blair and you will get back after 5:30PM only. The journey through the forest is also very good.

If lucky one can see the tribal ppl beside the road.We saw around 10 to 12 in our entire journey. One is not allowed to stop,honk,interact or walk around. Nothing special and basically one s sitn n the car and going for a ride. Once the forest area is crossed v need to board a vessel to go to the other side for mud volcano & limestone cave. it takes around 15min. The cave & the volcano are ntn special as to what they are propagated. Extremely tiring journey & not worth it. Can be skipped. More",Nov-16

An interesting journey to the caves,MeenakshiB111,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,17-Nov-16,"Baratang Island might seem disappointing for many as it is not like the other islands in andaman. There are no such attractive beaches but there are many natural occurrings to see and observe. 
The limestone cave is situated between the mangrove forests in Baratang Island. You have to take the high speed jet boat to reach the island where the cave is situated. The boats are very limited so one has to wait for long time to get his turn and can be quiet tiring too so be prepared. The journey is 25mins in boat and then 30 mins of walking (trekking). The boat ride can be a bit scary as the tides are high and the boat jumps on the water. When you reach the island you can see mangroves densely present and if lucky one can also spot the giant crocodile. Then after 2 kms of trekking you reach the caves. Where you can witness naturally forming limestones. 

P.S: do drink the lemon water from the stalls outside the cave. 

For me it was a great place as I am a nature lover :P so please be patient to see the greatness ;) More",Oct-16

It is strictly forbidden to take any photos, in this stretch or to interact with the Jarwas in any way if one happens to see them. 
Once the convoy reached the other side of the reserved forest, we had too take a short ferry ride to Baratang. From here we were supposed to take a speed boat to the Limestone Cave. Since there were no boats available, we were made to wait for two hours. After this we had another half an hours boat ride to the island where the cave is situated.

From there you hire a speed boat which takes you to Baratang limestone caves. Again the identity card, paper works etc. (it costs Rs 450/- per head for the speedboat) 
The outboard really zips you through the mangrove forests. We did see an alligator basking in the sun but the boat was too fast for me to click. As you near your destination the boat slows down and you wind your way through the smaller lanes of the mangroves. It’s a wonderful sight and one is reminded about the movie “Black Water” 
You get off the speed boat near the mangroves and walk. It’s a good trek for about 2 kms with tall trees and lush greenery all around you. 
The path twists and turns till you reach the limestone caves.

You can have your early morning cuppa here, with reasonably ok wash rooms, and a huge queue of vehicles awaiting approval to depart when the gates are opened. The Govt has done a fantastic job of strictly controlling the journey through the Jarawa Tribal Reserve. Vehicles are only allowed to depart in convoys 4 times a day with the first one departing at 6am. Security patrols escort the convoy at its front & rear and you cannot stop or take any pictures throughout this reserve forest. This is to protect the indigenous Jarawa tribals and they truly should be left alone if they are to survive. 

About 50 kms later, you reach a jetty with regular ferry trips to Baratang Island at the other end. Once across, book yourself a speedboat that will take you on a short ride through the mangroves across an unreal swamp leading to a secluded pit stop. From here walk 1.2 kms to the limestone caves - make sure you don't carry food items - just arm yourself with a camera as you pass through a picturesque path towards the caves. The limestone caves themselves seem unreal and are really quite beautiful. You can click pictures but do not touch anything as you will turn the natural limestone black & destroy it forever. Once done, return to your boat and journey back through the mangroves to Baratang. There's more at Baratang - we visited the only active volcano as well - see those notes in my other review. Take back great memories with you as your day ends with reaching Port Blair around 4pm. More",Mar-16
"Spectacular, adventerous",manumittal2k,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,11-Apr-16,"We visited this place during family trip. From Andaman we has to travel 6 hours on car and then on ferry and then finally tracking our way to Limestone Caves. 
But believe me it is worth going. 
Be sure to hire a good guide even if you have to pay a little bit extra (max 500 RS for 4 people...actually that is not much) 
It was sunny and hot on the daay we visited this place. 
When back to port, there is no good place to have food. 
But there is an oasis...a canteen on rooftop thhat serves unlimited amount of Dal, Sambhar, Rice and two dry curries for 100 INR. Very good value for money and the taste is awesome. 
For people going to Andaman, Baratang, limestone caves is a good day trip.

Nature's Surprise,Fun_Frolics,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,06-Apr-16,There is half an hour boat ride from Baratang to this cave. You are about to reach when you enter the mangrove forests. After boat ride there is also a long walk (20 min) to reach the caves but you will definitely not disappointed.

Scenic beauty of Mangroves,charuverma735,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,05-Apr-16,"The convoy journey to Baratang is a waste. The jeep driver would tell stories about the tribe which is completely illogical. Jarawa sighting would be made equivalent to alien explorations, with people showing off about the number of Jarawa they saw. There is nothing much in limestone caves either. The guide would draw resemblance of cave structure with different figures eg.Ganesh idol. One should visit this place only for the boat ride from jetty to caves. Surrounded by mangroves from both sides, narrow water passage leading to a small wooden platform, would seem like a live movie scene. Sit in the front of the boat,where water drops splash on your face, and you would be the most happiest person. More",Dec-15

One has to pass a small strait (Middle Strait) to reach Baratang. No bridge has been constructed for the same, so a streamer carries passengers as well as bus to one end from another end of the strait .After crossing the strait; we went to baratang caves through speed boats. After getting out of speed boat, one has to walk for around one and half kilometer to reach caves. Trek passed through mangrove forest and that journey was amazing. Finally reached limestone caves, they were worth watching, one gets amazed how stones have naturally taken shapes of Hindu mythological figures ( sankh, Lord Ganesha). One must remain closed to guide, as he carries a torch which enables you to take the pictures. Also please mind your head. One have to come back by the same boat and boat one also serves your guide for the caves 

Coming back from caves, we went to other wonder - Mud Volcano. Information about the volcano has been displayed, it is a must visit place for science geeks .

Eventually I was luckier than my wife, to have a glimpse of two people standing on the roadside. The journey ended in Middle Straight Jetty 
From Middle Straightr jetty, we have to cross over to Baratang by ferry service. The ferry not only carries passengers but also cars, buses etc. It is very much crowded, so we preferred to go to the upper deck. You can cross it seating in your own vehicle also but you will deprive yourself from the green beauty of the river side. 
For going to Lime stone caves again you need police permission. After getting it you have to get yourself enlisted with a speed boat and wait for your turn. Journey is about for half an hour but beautiful. You have to come back in the same boat, so normally the boat man accompanies you as a guide. It is about two Km trekking through dense forest, which begins with mangrove forest. We enjoyed the walk to reach the Limestone caves very much, though we were a little bit of tired.

It's not just the destination, but the journey that was truly amazing. With lush green trees and forest that seemed to have No animals at all, the peaceful silence was truely liberating. After crossing the Jarawa land, we headed for the limestone caves. A small boat would take you to one of the most amazing mangroves in the world. We were excited to pass through a tunnel that was natrually made by mangroves criss-crossing each other. We were advised to keep our hands off water as there could be crocodiles around(but we didn't see any). There is a short walk of 1.5 to 2 k.m. to the limestone caves that we had to walk. It was not tiresome, rather enjoyable with beautiful jungle and rocks that seem to have come out directly from below the sea. After refreshing ourselves with cool lime water our guide took us to one of the most amazing sights, pure white limestone caves, cast out naturally by dripping water from the tall trees.

Going through reserve forest (possibility of seeing jarwas), then ferry (15 minutes) then speed boat (30 minutes) overall a good experience but my main concern is spending a whole day for visiting limestone. 

The cave itself was good. Complete darkness within the cave. So, you need a torch. 
From the island, you need to walk a little less than 2 kms (not very smooth road). Will take half an hour. Winter time will be soothing but other time, Andaman is normally very hot. So, we mostly exhausted with the heat. 

Overall I would rate Limestone cave average only because, it's a hectic journey and spending whole day. Leaving the limestone cave, over all journey was very nice. 
Basically after seeing Boro Cave, it's not worth visiting Limestone cave in Baratang. 

No hotels near cave. Only few street shops where you can get fresh lime water. 
You can have lunch in the 2nd island from where you will be taking the speed boat to visit the island. Prebook your lunch otherwise, foods will not be available after 2 pm. More",Oct-15

I would say its not worth going there.,Ravi S,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,12-May-15,"If you are going to Bharatang to see the caves and the mud volcano, then i would recommend not to do this. If you are going there using a travel agent, your trip would start around 4 in the morning and it takes around 3 hours to get there from Port Blair. After which one needs to take a ferry across and then a speed boat to reach the limestone mangroves. Which is again followed by 1.5 Km walk. The 1.5 KM walk to the cave is an amazon one but the cave is ok at the best. After the you come back to the Jetty point and take a jeep to reach the mud volcano spot followed by some 800 mts trek. I am sure 90% of the people visiting the mud volcano will be disappointed as it looks no more than a a small ant hill. All this will be done by 12 PM. After that you cannot return back as the roads are closed and wont open up untill 3 PM (to protect the tribals).But if you are going to north Andaman you should defensively make a pit stop here and visit the limestone caves.

"Cool limestone Caves, but needsa long walk!",Sivaram S,"Chennai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,12-May-15,"We started from Port Blair in the morning. Long wait to have the vehicles grouped for the check post clearance. There was a nearby petty shop serving ot Idlies/Dosa/Paratha, which considerably helped to manage our break fast as well the wait time of around 1 hr 30 min. Though little bored journey to our kids, we made them excited by telling stories on Jarwa's & we were able to spot few of Jarwa's too. Limestone Cave is cool and nice, however we need to walk around 2 KM in the hot weather. Boat ride inside the mangrove was dramatic experience. Food at the Baratang jetty was not good and we don't have any choice too. Other than the limestone cave & boat ride inside mangrove trees, nothing much to say worthy. More",May-15

Our journey to Limestone Caves started at about 6:30 am. We were told earlier the better. After sometime of city drive, we were on Andaman Trunk Road. It was a mesmerising journey.

The most mesmarizing experience was yet to come. As the boat is eased into a tiny temporary wooden jetty at Nayadera Creek climbing a few steps to the landing, a Board greets the visitors- “Mangrove Canopy Walk”. The Mangrove Canopy Walk itself is a life time experience. This is about 5 minutes walk through a narrow bridge made of Forest produce, There are information boards in Hindi and English, eco huts, sit-outs and sit-outs. After getting off the bridge, there is yet another 1 and a ½ km walk through village and tropical forest filled with jungle flora and fauna. The experience of forest and sea journey is memorable. It is an amazing experience you really shouldn't miss! Some of the important items which people can carry along with them during this journey include some water, umbrella, cap, Wearing canvas shoes is a better idea. After the walk through the forest, cave comes in view. 
Limestone caves 
The Andaman and Nicobar Islands is a paradise for the nature lovers.- a beautiful place which provides an ideal vacation. 
Limestone caves are located at Nayadera near Wrafters Creef (near Baratang Island jetty) and a must visit for all those who are in Andaman Nicobar. The moment we got in, the caves we saw huge deposit of Limestone. The rocks inside, immediately gathered our attention. The erosion have formed some unique shapes All those who visited the caves with us expressed their astonishment and surprise about the wonders of nature. I am not a geologist. We are told that there are hundreds of such caves, but only one is open for tourists. I have no personal knowledge about the life of the rocks; and/or the geological features of that area, or even the geometry of rock-formation, their weathering and/or erosion and sedimentation. However, we were told that these rocks are as old as the origin of man-kind or may be still earlier. To me, these were just Wonderful and beautiful. Just look at the formations, imagine of anything you love or the God you worship and you visualize it in the formation. These: (i) icicle-shaped formations that hang from the ceilings of the caves, and which are produced by precipitation of minerals from water dripping through the cave ceiling and the (ii) formations that are vertical and grow from the ground up, can be seen at all over the caves. We are also told that such caves are also seen in California Cavern's Jungle. We were definitely reminded of Sea Caves of Phang Nga Bay near Phuket. The company of an experienced guide (there are so many available right there) with LED lights, will make the trip more enjoyable as you might get to know some interesting facts about the local tribes and the history of these caves. We saw fantastic formations of lime stones which is a real treat to eyes and a sensuous feel. No words can describe the caves. The caves are a sight to behold. Limestone caves, in my view, are one of the top three reasons for Andaman-Nicobar Holidays. Other two being Radhanagar Beach and Cellular jail (not in order). In view of the fact that caves are natural and not man-made, but in the Island forest (in fact near the Rain forest), please do not expect infra-structure. There is only one entry and the same way is exit. There are small huts to take rest where you can also have some fresh lime-water, cucumber and other refreshments, like tender coconut and snacks. The local population is not much. More",Mar-15
Its not worth the distance...,Abhijeet69,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,27-Apr-15,I found it not worth the kind of distance you travel... We started at 7 AM and returned back at 6:30 PM. First you need to travel for an hour from port blair to reach the check post. Then will take two hours to reach ferry point to Baratang it ill take another 25 mins to cross by ferry which is too much crowded.. then 20 mins by speed boat and then another half an hour walk and max 10 mins to see the Limestone clave.. after that you come back to ferry point have your lunch and wait for ferry after you cross then you need to wait for hours as authorities will allow to go back only at 3:30 PM and not before that then again 2+1 hour drive down to Port Blair... Not worth More,Apr-15

Not everyone's cup of tea,IshMalhotra,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,05-Apr-15,"It's a long expensive trip. So go only if the following experience appeals to you: 
1) A truly local ferry - which is used to cart everything from buses to people to the islands 
2) ""Spotting"" the Jarawa people, who are usually (thankfully) far removed from the rest of the world 
3) Mangrove forests. Your boat will pass from between these unique forests in fact. 
4) If you enter in the earliest convoy (6am) you can also visit another geographical rarity - the mud volcanoes. 
5) Lastly, lime stone caves. They are really just caves. But if you are fascinated by the chemical process - go visit!",Mar-15

We booked the tour from Wandoor and the journey started at 7 am with 2 hours stop at the check point for registration before passing The Jarawa's reserved area.

When returned to Baratang jetty we went to the canteen upstairs (be careful, the metal stairs are not very comfortable).

Extraordinary: The Living Caves,Abhishek K,"Bangalore, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,15-Mar-15,"These caves are a feat of nature telling us that nature itself is a living. The limestones of these caves grow with each passing year, they grow old and they die. 

To start i would say the journey to these caves is just as extraordinary as the caves themselves. passing through the wild mangroves which enter into the sea and grow in the harsh sea water conveying that this is my area and I will grow here. the feeling of the expanding nature the shine of the leafs while you are in the speed boat towards the island will give any photographer shots of his lifetime. 

the walk through the wild and the old tribal villages through the Jarawa area is really amazing. giving you a view of the exhausting nature in which we live. 

The caves themselves are a work of Art, the darkness in which they dwell the slight drops of water that continuously falls and forms structures patterns that only nature could design.

Motorboat which sailed us through the magnificient mangroves... it was such an awesome experience...after a long walk trough the terrain we reached the limestone caves spot... 
the guide gave us a good description flashing LED lights on the Dark Cave...

different... Overall i would say dont miss the Opportunity for this 1day Excurssion which is a

Let imagination soar,Sukanya D,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,17-Oct-14,"Our trip started at an unearthly 3.40AM...when Monica Travels (MT) sent a bus to pick us up. We then picked up co-passengers from other hotels and made it to a meeting point for the convoy to pass at around 6 ish in the morning. At the checkpoint a Pay and us toilet was much welcome. Our travel agent had sorted out our papers with MT so we had no problems. Then ALL cameras and mobiles had to be zipped up as the convoy started through the Jarawa tribal reserve forest...such flowers, birds and mushrooms...never to be clicked again. Anyway, finally we made it to the ferry. We boarded it on foot although one big bus crossed on the ferry. Stay away from the kerosene fume laden exhausts. The sail experience is fantastic. Photography is allowed. When the ticket checker came we said we were with MT and that was that! Then we waited a bit at the waiting hall (it has clean drinking water....but try the green coconut water instead...Rs 20 for one with the soft flesh thrown in) There is a Pay toilet. Dogs sauntered in. Then we boarded small boats wearing very uncomfortable life jackets which seemed to me to have blocks of thermocol sewed inside. I wonder if these work in emergencies.

The boat trip is FANTASTIC. 
MT served us packed breakfast...some tourists disposed of the empty packets in the sea...it is terrible how we abuse nature. Mangrove vegetation abounds. Then, the boat took us deep into the creeks...it is a super spectacular experience ducking to avoid the branches even as the pilot expertly steered the boat, whistling to signal arrival at blind turns. 
The jetty is large enough and a bridge with mangrove vegetation piercing it leads to the trail 
It is a gentle hike but at places the path is narrow, uneven and there are sharp drops. There is the risk of slipping. Good footwear is a MUST...ladies wearing fancy heels and flat chappals (slippers) were finding it difficult to negotiate. A few had picked up branches as walking sticks...I did not need one but it seemed like a good idea. Bamboo guard rails are fragile/rotting...grasping one or leaning is an invitation to trouble. There is a toilet here as well but long queues...and a hut that had NO AMENITIES but which was supposedly for emergencies. 
The cave fascinated me as a person with a scientific background. The lime rich water has over time created fabulous patterns which you could allow your imagination to run riot over. There was one sink hole right at the very top that let in light and air. I'd have been happy to stand and stare but our guides harried us all through..even a small stop to click a photo met with their vocal disapproval. 
To many visitors the supposed resemblances to Hindu deities was a matter of wonder. Yet others were vocal about their disappointment. They had expected more...but I gathered they did not really know what they had come to see. 
It must be understood that this is a natural creation...an object of wonder...a place where one marvels at Mother nature...this is not an urban amusement park...a mall...or a movie hall. 
The cave itself is dark and an ordinary two battery torch I carried was not much use. The guide from the boat carried brighter lights which he used for short flashes...my pictures therefore are not satisfactory. 
Food on Baratang is bad. Our group of 20 people were given lunch at a small stall by MT. We found white coloured worms in the cooked rice (some had eaten without noticing), hair and plastic fibers (from the bag in which dry rice was stored). 5 of us came down with bad tummy immediately afterwards. I did not see any stall/hotel I can recommend. If I go again, I will forget the free meal (with ticket) the travel company gives but drink the coconut water and eat the tender flesh....or carry cup noodles and ask for hot water...or eat biscuits/bread. 
Bottomline: Donot miss the boat ride to the cave and enjoy the hike. Let Mother Nature's simple display awe you. Enjoy the mangroves, birds, butterflies, flowers....breathe. More",Oct-14

But make sure you finish it fast and return to Nilampoor and take a vehicle and visit the Mud volcano, this is also not that interesting, you will have to walk for some 5-10 mins to reach the epi centre of the Volcano. You will find a small slushy area where liquid mud is thrown out in small bubbles. But again ensure that you make it fast, so that you can again board the Jetty by 11.30-12.00 and reach Middle Strait before 12.30 so that you can travel by 12.30 Convoy back in the reserved area.

If you are not able to reach by 11.30-12.00 to Nilampoor then don’t take the Jetty coz the other side you will not get any food.

A dinghy smelly boat will transport you to Baratang Island. There you catch a speedboat to the mouth of the jungle where caves are located. The final stretch of 2 kilometers have to be done on foot. After all this you see some natural limestone formations in a dark cave where guides ask you to imagine various shapes looking at them. It lasts for about 10 minutes and is decidedly underwhelming.

Overall, the journey is beautiful, and when you ultimately reach the final leg, you have to hike through a rough terrain, (which I later found out was not necessary, since there was another smooth way through the nearby villages). When you reach the Limestone caves, it is not so great, specially if you have seen better caves before. However for first timers, it is a nice experience. They do not let you in deep inside the cave, so you are limited to only the front part of the cave, and see whatever they have to show you.

The Natures beauty in the formation of the caves with a small hole at the top for water and light to flow is worth a watch.

To reach the Baratang Limestone Caves, you need to take a boat ride through mangroves. On reaching the end you will be warned of crocodiles. Then you have to stroll through a tropical forest of 1.5 km length which is really thrilling with noises of insects in the background. As you enter the caves, you are welcomed by a snake tucked beneath a stone on the left-side.

This was not the very enjoyable journey as the sun was right above our heads and it was too hot out there.And since we had seen a lot of mangroves, we didn't enjoy it much. But when our boat entered inside the mangroves through a creack it was just... We almost had dropped the idea of visiting Baratang considering the fact that one has to start at 4.30am and to travel about 100 km by road.But ultimately decided to go to Baratang. 
We started exactly at 4am-on 
8th November.Reached at about 5.30am at the check post .The administration allows all the vehicles to go which arrive before 6am 
Similarly the next convoy goes at 9 am.and at 12 noon. 
No vehicle is allowed in between.Once the convoy starts, it goes on till it reaches the jetty.No stopping, no photography and no any other business except moving.The journey through the very thick green jungle is just a mesmerising experience. It is so dense and thick.I wonder how the JARAWAS the tribal people live there. 
Our most cherished desire was to have a glimpse of JARAWAS. But this was not to happen.Anyway we reached the jetty in about 1.30hr covering a distance of about 50 km through the forest. 
Crossed over to other side to Baratang jetty by a ferry.This big ship sails to and fro at short interval. 
From Baratang jetty we were taken on a speed boat to Limestone cave. This was not the very enjoyable journey as the sun was right above our heads and it was too hot out there.And since we had seen a lot of mangroves, we didn't enjoy it much. But when our boat entered inside the mangroves through a creack it was just an awesome experience. There was a narrow strip canal like way with shrubs trees leaves roots on both sides and over our heads.It was just wonderful.I guess the backwater of Kerala will be similar. We reached the jetty soon.The scenery around was just astounding. 
From jetty it was about a half km to go through a very green bright jungle though a difficult path.Out of jungle there were lovely paddy fields, huts and cows,ducks,hens etc.Finally we reached at a place from we were to to the cave in small groups. Till it was our turn we enjoyed the sweet salty and tangy lime juice. Our guide took us inside the cave.It is just superb marvellous and grand.It is a huge long cave with naturally built different structures and designs.It must be seen to be believed. It is just awesome! 
We returned back to Baratang jetty by 12 noon. Our taxi driver told us not to go to Mud volcano as there is nothing special to see there.But we insisted to go and we went there. This also was a very good experience. There were bubbles coming out of small holes in mud.The bubbles were not hot,I touched them.This was altogether a different experience.On way back to jetty we took buffet lunch in a hotel at a surprisingly low rate Rs 70 per head .It was a good lunch. 
Finally we started back at 3pm for Portblair. 
By now we were a little tired and after lunch we all were taking a nap but of course there was a feeling in our minds that we just couldn't see the JARAWAS. 
It had rained that afternoon in the forest. 
I also was snoozing, sitting on front seat. All of a sudden my sister in law shouted 'JARAWAS'.We all woke up and saw 3 persons a male, a female and a baby.The male was on left side while the female and the baby were on right side. We saw them but it was a passing view and all of us were sleepy.Anyway we thanked the lady luck as we had seen almost everything. 
After about 15th.we saw a young male JARAWA coming from front with arrows and a bow and had worn something like half pant. This time we had a very clear and close view. In this way our mission was completed with a grand success and satisfaction. 
We reached our hotel Ashiana Residency Inn at about 7th. 
We had hired an ac Sumo vista for Rs4500 plus Rs 300 per head for tickets etc.from Paradise Tours and Travels.We had booked online. 
Next review will be on Sea walk and Scuba diving. 
Thanks.

Adventure..Baratang completes the experience of Andaman tour,subhamay_pal,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,26-Oct-13,"Passing through the Jarwah land..then boating through the mangroves.. then a 2KM walk to enter into a dark limestone cave..Baratng actually completes the experience of Andaman tour. We started early at 4AM and reached Joretang at 5:30. Convoy starts at 6AM to cross the Jarwah reserve (the area is protected and photography is not allowed). We reached the jetty where ferry will take you to the other side where speed boat starts. Speed boats take you through the mangorve forests to a place from where you need to walk through the rough roads to the lime stone cave. The walk is really enjoying, but is avoidable for aged persons. The limestone cave is dark and guide will show you with their torch the different shapes that has been created on the walls and rrof of cave. This is very natural and big. The whole experience was really adventurous. A must for all Andaman goers. 
The boating was charged 300 including pass and one must carry water and dry foods as there will be no eartery except some small stalls selling lemon water (sweet and salty). More",Oct-13
Something like heaven for a nature enthusiasts,sophizz,"Chennai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,07-Oct-13,"Baratang Island is not much known to tourists. It has a scenic coastline rich in marine life and mud volcanoes, the only known examples in India. It is located between Middle and South Andaman about 100 km from Port Blair. The island has dense tropical forests ranging from tidal swamp forest to evergreen to littoral forests laced with sandy beaches along its coast. The easiest way to reach Baratang was to book with a tourist, since it involved permissions from the forest department . The trip starts as early as 3.30 am! Sleepy heads we wakeup and get ready for all the excitement that was following. Baratang Island can be reached by road via the Jarawa Tribe Reserve and then by boat. Jarawa are one of those indigenous communities of Andaman Islands. Jarawas are believed to have inhabited the islands for at least several thousand years. Photography is strictly prohibited in this Jarawa Tribe Reserve area! After driving the Jarawa tribe reserve for nearly 3 hours we reach the ferry place.

The weight had to be balanced or the boat would topple over into the creek containing salt water crocodiles and poisonous snakes. This adventurous ride goes for 40-45 mins and we reach a rocky terrain. It was drizziling and we had to do rock climbing to see the limestone caves at Nayadera! 

The path is slippery and we weren’t prepared with any special shoes. I wore flip-flops and did rock climbing and badly bruised my leg everywhere! I had to do it anyways, the beauty of nature kept me going… finally I was the first one to enter into the pristine limestone caves, awed in beauty, I stood like one of those stalagmites and stalactites ! The venomous snakes or the salt water crocodiles didn’t scare me 

Tips: carry proper shoes (trekking or hiking shoes), wear proper clothing (shorts and T -shirts preferred), carry a water proof jerkin (light weight) if you suspect rains. Drink a lot of water, stay hydrated. More",Sep-13

Mud Volcano and Limestone Caves in Middle Andaman,saimee,mumbai,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,21-Sep-13,"It is located in Baratang Island. For Details of Mud volcano , FAQ please see the photos attached. This place is recommended for students interested in science. There is nothing much to appreciate if you donot understand the science behind it. 

Regarding limestone caves I would suugest it is worth watching. In natural way how different shapes like ""Sankh""(used in hidu rituals), Ganesha(Hindu god) etc are formed. 
Tips;- Be careful while going to these 2 locations. the road is in very bad condition, muddy, slippery.You should be very close to the guide otherwise you will not be able to take a snap. please carry a torch.",Nov-12
Much ado about nothing,1samrat,"Calcutta, West Bengal, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,11-Sep-13,"Visiting natural limestone caves sounds very exciting. But before one embarks on the journey to Baratang, one needs to be clear about his/her personal motto during a trip. Most people visit Andaman to be in the tranquility of mother nature, to enjoy few moments of carefree solitude, away from the busy schedules of life. They get all the luxury of modern life co-existing with natural beauty. There are another group of people, who do not care about the remoteness of a place, their love for nature is for nature, notwithstanding the danger it possess. Baratang has one single attraction of lime caves, but it is almost 100 km away from Port Blair, and consumes the whole day in traveling. it is the most hectic schedule in entire Andaman trip, and one has to start very early in the morning, journey by bus for almost 8-9 hours, constantly seated in a confined area. The travel agencies promise that we will surely encounter some of the tribal on our way through forest, but in reality, they seldom, if ever come near the bus road from their abode in deep jungle. so spotting the 'Jaroya' tribe on the way is a 'myth'....if you have to get near them, you have to arrange it by some other ways. Then one has to travel in a shared launch (they call it ship), which can be best described as 'hell'. There are limited seats, many passengers,...

The whole vessel reeks of smell of urine, and the windows are very very small, so the heat becomes unbearable in the sultry sea wind. There is not much natural beauty exclusive to this part, you are surely to see all these coastal beauty during your visit to numerous other better destinations in Andaman. Then alighting from the launch, one has to walk a very difficult stretch of land to reach the lime caves. And if you have any predetermined ideas about lime cave from similar ones in US or other parts of the world, just forget it. it is dark inside, no arrangements for lighting, so all you get to see is with torchlight from your guide. The ground is all muddy with the water from the cave, and there is huge rush of tourists and subsequent pushing and shoving. Even taking photographs with flash is difficult as huge amount of dust fill up the cave. This whole trip is to keep this area of Andaman thriving, so this is included in all package tours. And after being disappointed, you have to return through the same path, subjected to the same grinding once again. If you love to feel inner peace with nature, skip this tour. If you are one who always pick up the sugar and ajwain at the end of a meal at the restaurant, just because you paid for it, then go for it. i strictly discourage aged people, particularly with chronic illness, from going for this 8-9 hours journey, as there are no surity they'll get adequate food and drinking water during the journey.

Good place to visit,WhiteSandAndaman,"Port Blair, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,30-Apr-13,"Trip to the Baratang Island is a must visit, on your way you would see dense forest, Jarawa tribe members(not common) and mangroves. Also included are dongi ride through mangroves and trekking through dense forest to reach the Limestone caves. 

Usually operated by Government Tourism bus. The trip starts early in the morning. The journey takes around 3 hours before you reach the Baratang Jetty.From the Jetty you would take a dongi and would pass through dense mangrove forest to reach the starting point of the Limestone cave. On your way you would pass through the Jarawa Tribal Reserve. Make sure that you don't offer food or take pictures of the tribes. The Government is quite strict with people offering food to the indigenous tribes. 

Check with your travel operator before travelling to Baratang Island as sometimes the Government closes this route after demands from various organisations to preserve the tribes and limit exposure to the tourists. More",Jan-13

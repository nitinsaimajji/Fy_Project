A RARE EXPERIENCE,SubrataCh,India,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,10-Dec-18,One have to walk at least 1 km to reach the coral bridge from the parking lot to reach at natural coral bridge and over the corals as well. The beach is quiet and scenic (Laxmanpur 2). Taking a guide will be better because he could explain the natural information and fact about the bridge. Take some beautiful snaps here. Actually the coral bridge doesn't look like Howrah Bridge from any angle; the fact is 80% of the inhabitants of Neil are Bengalis and perhaps they have provided such name. It is made with raw natural corals and the size is increasing day by day. Really a visual delight.,Oct-18

5.) Guide would show you star fish, sea cucumber, sea urchin, neon fish, zebra fish, lobsters, sea leech, crabs, which you may not notice without the guide.

Must visit,Shalini S,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,27-Jun-18,"Howrah bridge is a unique rock formation which attracts hordes of tourists. It requires climbing across a small hillock - there are steps uphill and a tiled passage going downhill. Gets slippery in the rains.Thereafter one has to walk for about 100 meters on sand/rocks on the beach to reach Howrah bridge. Hence it is advisable to wear comfortable footwear, preferably flat. It is difficult to access for the elderly. 
As one walks , the bridge slowly reveals itself. Located at the edge of azure blue waters, it is stunning. Lovely location for photographs 
If one looks carefully, one can also spot jellyfishes, hermit crabs etc amidst the rocks on the beach. 
If one is more adventurous and keeps walking after crossing the Howrah bridge, one finds a greater variety of marine life. Also there is a similar bridge like formation, although smaller, a little further.....

While taking Neil Island halt in itinerary especially for this one thing; had a feeling that it is one of the nature's wonder but only about that (nothing scenic about it). 

Thankfully we met lady tourist on her way back who really insisted that the real thing is marine life around that gets exposed during low tide (we had coordinated visit with low tide) and to show that we should hire local guide. 

Real thanks to her we hired Nirmal Ghosh 70639 18088. He showed us lot of marine life around in tour of about 45 minutes. Thoroughly enjoyed and was memorable experience. 

Small tip -- do not be taken back by muddy appearance of shore. It is not mud where your feet can get stuck, it is hard dead coral so just walk on it without worries to reach the bridge and marine life around it. 

There is second similar bridge at some distance behind this one, reportedly formed in tsunami; which is visible. When I asked about that, there was interesting comment from guide --- 'it was formed in tsunami, it has no guarantee' More",Mar-18

So beautiful!,hershey272,"New York City, New York",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,02-Feb-18,This is a natural rock formation which can be accessed during low tide.

The rock formation itself is very beautiful and forms a great backdrop for photography. Be careful to return before high tide starts coming in or you can get stuck! Overall do visit.,Apr-17

A Natural Wonderland with Marine biology for dummies,Nikhil A,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,13-Jan-18,"This is a rocky area of Neil Island's coast full of tide pools (google it) and associated marine life that has been cleverly used as a tourist destination, allowing the normally oblivious visitor an upclose and personal look at the life around them. 
The place is full of natural beauty and wonder and a must visit when on the island! The area is uneven and rocky, it is advisable to have good quality water resistant footwear when visiting because you DO NOT want to be walking barefoot on this beach. 
Local 'guides' are plentiful charging approx Rs300/hr. They act to point out what lies in these pools, and the information they give out is rather simplified. For example they point out a sea anemone and refer to it as ""touch me not magic flower"" before going on to poke it incessantly. You will see more or less everything without a guide as well because of all the commotion other peoples guides make. More",Jan-18

Generally these are expected timings however very difficult to predict the low tide . 

We met an excellent young boy who was our guide when we reached Coral gate. Name is 9679589483 - Rajesh Das. I've given his number also so you can call him a day in advance and check when's the best time to come. Really excellent guide good knowledge and he really helps you see real good sea life. 

The Coral gate is a really good photography experience and you can take some good snaps there. There waves are awesome white in colour and gives a feeling you are standing in midst of snow. 

You need to check the shallow waters and the stones you will sea all kids to sea life from colourful small fish , sea urchins , loads of star fish , small corals , sea animone , many snail, sea cucumber, crabs etc . If you have kids they will enjoy even more. You can only enjoy this experience in low tide as on hide tide the water gets filled up. Infact even hide even going to the natural gate is very difficult. You must take the guide I've mentioned below as hel help find all show you all these. 

We caught some star fish and crabs etc was really fun place. Also touched sea touch me nots which are orange in colour , different types do corals snails etc . 

It was a truely amazing and fun experience in the midst of real sea life . Totally enjoyed and took really good photographs as well.

However, Natural Bridge is a great destination to click some photographs to add these to your Facebook profile yet the rock does not attract much. Instead, Sunset was more charming than the rock. You can spend 2-3 hours to enjoy the sunset, and click few pictures. The path to the rock is also fun, as you must be alert to avoid stepping on the fishes and the lobsters. The lobsters keep popping out of rocks, and in the small streams you can see tiny fishes which are busy in their day to day activities. 

There are various small shops on the way to the rock where you can energize yourself with lime soda and cucumbers. It is best to skip the place if you are coming here for sunset only. 

Please note that it is best to know the tide pattern once you reach to Neil. You must plan your trip either in the morning or in the evening to Natural Bridge according to the tide pattern. Otherwise such trip would waste your time and energy. More",Apr-17

I think this is the closest you can get to the wild sea creatures while walking.

Further, if you still have some juice left after the walk to the bridge.You can also climb up the bridge and get some excellent views of the surrounding islands and the sea.The hike is a bit difficult because of the high inclination, shrubs and bushes on the way.It will take approximately 20 minutes to reach the top. 
The hike to the bridge is a MUST DO, if you looking for some adrenalin rush :)

The way to the point is through a muddy trekking route which is quite tough a trek. Not suitable for people with limb problem, pregnant ladies and babies. Especially during rains,there is no shade and using umbrella might not be feasible as the space is very narrow. It becomes very slippery to hold your grip on foot. There are private garden trees to take support if needed. However plucking is strictly prohibited.

This bridge leads from no where to no where.The view is excellent, the access to this point is by walking only , walking initially on plain land and then on rough coral surface, during a low tide, select your foot wear accordingly, once the structure is in view, one does feel ""it was worth the trek"" , saw some tourist go back with out seeing the bridge ,they were advice by the locals to turn right on the plain path to get a distant view from a point,, but nothing like seeeing it up and close.

Looks amazing and makes you feel why this was made by nature,Hemant_Wadhwani,"Pune, Maharashtra, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,25-Mar-16,"It is accessible after a small trek via some trees and then rocks. Accessible only in day when the tide is low. 
I went with the kids and I found the kids jumping around the rocks and passed through them while the adults were more cautious. Some rocks are sharp edged and can make a cut so one need to be careful. 

The more exiting thing for the kids was the crabs near the rocks than the bridge formation. 

I feel that there is nothing much around in Neil so this is one destination marked for tourists to get some pics clicked. Apart from that I do not feel there was anything more than that. Yes I agree that the formation of stones in a form of bridge is an attractive place to get clicked. More",Mar-16

Nice place for a day trip,SonjaN_13,"Tampere, Finland",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,06-Jan-14,"This is really calm beach especially in the morning. When it is low tide you can walk under the stone bridge. There is also a view point made up to the hill with benches to sit on. It was nice place to have some snack and enjoy the view. Actually there is two stone bridges. The other is little more far away but you can see it from the view point. If you visit Neil, this is a must visit. But take good shoes with you! 
PS: If it's hot day, you can swim if you take right from the bridge you end up to a small place with sand bottom. More",Dec-13

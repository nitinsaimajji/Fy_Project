The Most Beautiful Island in India,EshiTravelTalker,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,18-Apr-19,"If you are going to Andaman, then you must visit this beautiful island called Jolly Buoy. 
World's 2nd best corals after Australia are found here. This beach will surprise you with it's crystal clear water and natural beauty. However, this island is closed for 6 months so that the corals grow. So plan your visit during November - March.",Feb-19
Must see place in Andaman,Deepthi D,India,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,11-Apr-19,"If you visit Andaman, you should definitely plan to visit this place. You need to get permit and buy tickets the previous day itself. You should plan well ahead if you plan to visit this place. You can see beautiful corals, star fishes, sea anemones etc in this place. The jetty's start at 7 in the morning. You have to pack breakfast and come to this place. You cannot carry plastic bottles or plastic covers to this place. So plan and pack the food accordingly. 
There was one auto driver who helped us a lot in booking the tickets, his name is Gopal and his number is 9531918600/9933202151. He arranged for taxis to reach this place and also bought tickets. Any one planning to visit Andaman, can contact him. He will provide end to end travel plan and also help in booking government ferry tickets and sight seeing. He made our Andaman trip memorable.

Must must must visit,Devendra G,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,29-Mar-19,"During our last day on visit to andaman islands, we had an option to visit either bartang, or jolly buoy islands. We opted for Jolly buoy island and bartang travel was too tiring. However, what was to come was a real surprise. 

Jolly Buoy island is one of the 15 preserved islands in andaman. One can visit the island after obtaining necessary permit a day before the travel. Only very limited number of tourists can visit the island daily. One has to first visit wandoor jetty which is an hour drive from port blair. From jetty, one has to take a shared boat which takes more than an hour to reach Jolly Buoy island. 

This is a very small and beautiful island with clearly the best coral formation and cleanest water in andaman. The only activity available here is glass boat ride. However, it is way better to a glass bottom boat in havelock or Neil island. The coral formation and natural beauty is much much better than any other island. One can easily site star fishes, corals of different types, turtles and oysters. 

If you have a spare day in port blair, there is no other match to Jolly Buoy island. Must visit. More",Mar-19

The place is open only 6months a year. It's a national marine park and Govt permission is required to visit. Don't have to give up the idea of visit hearing the permission requirement; it's a simple application at tourism department office along with photo copies of identity card of all the members who are visiting. It cost INR 75. Apart from this you need to buy a ferry ticket which is INR 885. This also has to be pre purchased from the same office.

The boat ride from Wandoor to Jolly Buoy islands is 60min. On reaching the island, just before you disembark, your boat crew will make their pitch for taking a glass bottom boat ride with them for viewing corals. It's offered in 3 tiers of INR 300,INR 600 and INR 100O for varying duration of 15, 30 and 60 min. 
If you skip this, you get dropped on to island straight away from the ferry on the same glass bottom boat. But there's nothing else to do on the island other than gaze at emerald blue waters and the jungle, with thatched seating areas. 

Corals can be viewed only if you take the boat ride. The collection of corals and marine species you will witness is better than what you get to see during Scuba diving. The boat man will be a localite giving running commentary on corals in hindi. So non Indians will rely only on what they see and not hear. 

All in all you will get two hours on the island. There's no watersports or any such activity there. No food stalls or water point. A washroom and changing room is all that is there in the name of amenities. 

You can swim in the sea in a small cordoned of area. The water will beat the swimming pool of any five star hotel. More",Mar-19
Mesmerising corals,Shalini S,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,22-Feb-19,"The azure blue crystal clear waters surrounding Jollybuoy are simply perfect for snorkelling.

For those who don’t want to snorkel, glass bottomed boats are available. One can see the corals from these boats. There is a swimming area where one can swim in the perfectly clear waters. If one is lucky, one may be able to see baby fish also. It is indeed a fascinating sight..... 

This pristine island can be reached by ferry from Wandoor jetty, which is about 45 minutes away from Port Blair by car. A special visiting pass is required as this island is in protected marine reserve area and only a restricted number of visitors are allowed per day. The visit timing is also restricted. Since it gets really hot during the day, an early visit is advisable. 

No plastic is allowed on the island, hence one may carry water in flasks. Also, there are no shops or eating joints on the island so it is advisable to get a picnic lunch packed from the hotel and carry it especially if one has young kids.

Total cheating n waste of time,Gauravd43736,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,03-Dec-18,"The agent will take money in advance(1 or 2 days prior) saying that they need to take prior permissions from forest office 

On final day when one arrives at wandoor jetty they will take u to jolly bouy or red skin island n won’t tell u before boarding the boat 

Both these islands are just 2 kms from wandoor n clearly visible from the beach at wandoor but they will take u through the back waters so slowly to make it a 30 minutes boat ride which is actually just 10 min worth while coming back when they come directly through short route 
The agent will tell u jolly buoy but boat guy will take to red skin island 

Moreover the waiting time is almost 3 hours which is difficult to pass at red skin island 

So pls confirm the Destination before boarding the boat at wandoor

It is a day long trip from Port Blair. you need to take a cab to Wandoor beach and from there a ship will take you to Jolly Buoy Island. On your way, you will cross many islands and the trip is a tribute to the eyes. 
Jolly Buoy is the best place for glass bottom boat ride and snorkeling. The water is crystal clear and is perfect to look for corals.

First, you must reach to the jetty by 7 a.m. Its open roughly between 9 a.m. - 1 p.m. Before sitting in the boat all plastic bags has to be removed. A fine of Rs.2000 who found carrying it to the island. 
One has to rent water bottle (very nominal charges Rs.5 only, Rs.250 deposit for one ltr. Bottle). It’s a quite appreciable move, to save the island from plastic garbage. 
It takes hardly 10 min. to see the island, unless one wishes to see the marine life. 
Keep remember, once you go there, cannot come early, even if you do not wish to spend more time there. You must stay there for full time. 
You need sufficient quantity of water considering the requirement, till you arrive back to jetty. Nothing is sold on the island. You need to carry everything with you.

We have booked one trip glass bottom ride for one hour 1000/ per person. Different types of colourful fishes, star fishes, sea orchins, sea lilies, sea feather, different types of corals, and many other sea animals are seen clearly from a distance of even 50 meters. Amazing it is worth of it's price. We have visited the North Bay island but nothing is comparable to Jollubuoy island. I wanted to post the videos and pictures of the corals but this will belittle the true experience , so it is wise to see on your own . More",Apr-18
Touristy - but worth a look see,Dylan D,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,30-Apr-18,"I generally avoid these touristy places but Joly Buoy was highly recommended and rightly so. The Island especially the corals is beautiful. It is a tad bit crowded but its organized chaos. The ferry guys will try and sell you a snorkelling and glass boat trip - id suggest the snorkelling as the corals are spectacular. If not then the glass boat also works. The water is extremely clear and not too salty so a dip is totally worth it for the remaining time. 

Note- they do not allow any polythene or plastic on the island. The bags are strictly checked and plastics are removed. Any plastic water bottles are emptied into a school water bottle for a deposit. I think this is an excellent measure as the number of plastic been thrown around by tourists is apalling. More",Apr-18

Plastic is absolutely prohibited in this area, you even can’t carry disposable bottles instead they rent you water bottles at a reasonable price and also a jute bag to carry your eatables. The water is calm and so the snorkeling experience is better here. There are no water sports activities except snorkeling. This is in order to abstain the aquatic life disturbance.

Its an early morning (around 8am) travel by road to Wadnoor beach which is around 20-25 kms to the south of Port Blair airport.

Just short of the island, you are transported onto a floating jetty wherefrom you board the glass bottom boats. The complimentary glass bottom boat ride of 5 min is available to everyone to lure people into taking the paid glass bottom boat ride which costs around Rs.1000/- and is of one hour duration approx. The glass bottom boat ride very pretty and is a must to see marine life in unadulterated for. Since entry to the Jolly Buoy is highly regulated, so, the effects of nuisance due to tourists is not there which makes the marine life available in pure and unadulterated for. The corals are wonderful though most have been badly affected by the tsunami of 2005. The colourful view of the marine life is breathtaking including turtles and sea anemones and nemo.

My Holiday Trip to Andaman and Nicobar Islands,JewelG35,"Kochi (Cochin), India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,10-Apr-18,"I think I have visited a lot of places around the world. Travelling is fun to me and it's very interesting to me.I think Andaman is one of the beautiful Island in India I had ever visited. When I planned for Andaman trip, I was so excited and never thought the trip will be so terrible just because of the service provided by the tour operator Andaman Tour Travel. They help greatly in organising and planning my trip and stays in the place of wonders in Andaman. I think Portblair was the best beach I had ever visited in Andaman. The seafront cellular jail is the main attraction in Port Blair. If anyone planning for an Andaman trip I would say Bhattu Caves and Jolly Buoy are must-see places in Port Blair. And don't miss the coral reef boat ride in Jolly Boy. I would recommend all the viewers to plan for at least a week to stay in Port Blair. There are many hotels which would provide you accommodation at a decent price. Port Blair is a romantic place for couples. Honeymoon Packages in Andaman offers romantic holidays for just married couples. Allover the world I think Port Blair is the best place in India for holiday trips. More",Feb-18

Jolly Buoy Island - not to be missed during Andaman visit,SHAILESHK345,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,29-Mar-18,"Jolly Buoy Island is the best Island in Andaman to see live Corals. In fact in my view it is better than North Bay Island . The reasons are - 1. The water here is crystal clear and one can see the live corals even with naked eye. 2. There are more live corals, fishes and sea animals in Jolly Buoy Island as compared to North Bay Island. 3. Glass boat ride charges for viewing live Corals are much less as compared to North Bay Island. 4. Comfortable to swim in Jolly Buoy Island. However, it is advisable to do snorkling in Eleffanta beach in Havlock Island since the the masks available at Jolly buoy Island are pipe shaped and do not cover the entire face. Full face masks are more comfortable and are available at Eleffanta beach. Charges are same at both the Islands. More",Feb-18

Also, the crystal clear water is another attraction for this beautiful island. It has a maximum capacity of 250 people. So arrange this tour well in advance with your travel or tour operator. One needs permit to travel to this location. Don't leave Andaman without visiting this place. More",Mar-18

I visited this island in the 1st week of Feb and enjoyed the snorkeling here. I had heard that snorkeling had been temporarily stopped. However, it has resumed.

I had done scuba diving at Nemo reef in Havelock, however the corals and marine life at Jolly Buoy is far better than that at Nemo reef. The only issue is that the time for which the guide takes you to snorkel is not fixed and varies depending on the crowd and if he is in a rush to get other customers. Prices quoted by the guide is based on the marine life that he shows you. Instead suggest you to decide on the price based on the time that you are allowed to snorkel. Prices are typically 600 rs for just 15 mins of snorkeling. As mentioned by others you require a special permit to visit Jolly Buoy island. The agent I contacted was not very keen on getting the permit / ticket for me unless I also booked a taxi to reach wandoor jetty through him.

Incredible and Eco friendly,Jd and P G,"Ottawa, Canada",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Apr-17,"My husband and I both enjoyed the fact that preserving the island is a top priority here. They really did seem to care and take great cautions on limiting plastics and garbage on the island. That was quite reassuring. The snorkelling was amazing!! This was the first place we snorkelled so we didn't know how much things would cost- I can't help but feel that the pricing strategies there are a little bit ridiculous. They charge you way more to go out further but it really isn't much more time I feel that you get for that money. If you can convince the guides to let you go out on your own, you're better off. Either way incredibly beautiful – we would go back with our own scuba equipment next time. More",Feb-17

Excellent!!,ShitijV2,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,29-Jan-17,"The island is only open for 6 months in a year (November to May). The jetty is almost 45 minutes outside the Port Blair city. Once you reach the Jetty, ferry will take you to the island. The ferry trip takes around 1 hour and the view is very scenic with trees around on the both the sides. The water is very very clear and is perfect place for snorkelling. The corals are excellent here. There are also other activities such as Glass Bottom boat, which i feel is good for people who are scared of water, otherwise, snorkelling is better than doing the glass bottom boat. One very important thing to note is that the island is free from plastics i.e. no plastic bags are allowed, however, chips, biscuits can be carried along, provided you bring the empty packets back along with you to port blair. Also, there are no eateries on the island, which means you have to carry your lunch along with you. More",Jan-17

Snorkeling gear is provided with a flotation tube ( traditional snorkel mask and a sturdy plastic tube around your waist to help you afloat ) and a seasoned guide to take you around. In case you need a full face mask for snorkeling please carry your own if possible.

You cannot carry any plastic mineral water bottles. You can get water bottles on rent. Make sure you carry enough of them if you are going in summer. It will take one hour in the boat to reach Jolly Buoy. Life jackets are provided for all passengers. Once you reach the island you will be amazed by nature and clean ocean around it. Waves are not so strong, so kids can also enjoy swimming. You will find instructors for snorkeling (mostly they will be part of the ferry's crew) and this is one experience you should not miss.

Note 1: Carry an underwater camera if you can as you would love those pics for life. Boat guys didn't have it here. 
Note 2: Jolly Buoy is operation 6 months only, rest months they open Red Skin Island. They close these islands for letting corals develop naturally. So before planning, please check which island will be operational at your tour time.

Snorkelling at this island is the best compared to entire Andaman,if you have missed your chance of scuba diving at Havelock than trying snorkelling will give almost the same under water experience.

Awe striking experience,Jktra,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Mar-16,"This is a must visit. Since Jolly Buoy is a protected island, the water here is as clear as glass. And the fishes!!! amazing..I had never witnessed such a sight before. Fishes of all shapes and sizes and colours swimming past you. An unforgettable experience. It is better to visit Jolly Buoy before you move on to Havelock or any other island. The snorkelling here is much better than any other place. Also each person has one guide who takes an effort to tell you the name of every fish and coral which you come across. We did scuba at Havelock after Jolly Buoy. but during scuba the instructor cannot tell you the names or descriptions of the sights you see. Because I had prior knowlege obtained during Jolly Buoy sightseeing, I enjoyed scuba because I knew what i was seeing and could appreciate the same. The fishes and corals also could be seen clearly through the glass bottom boat. We took an extra 45 min ride for Rs.600/- per head. Those who cant do snorkelling can see through the glass bottom boat. You have to reach wandoor jetty from where ferries depart for Jolly Buoy. All the ferries depart one after the another. Tickets are difficult to obtain since they are not available online and many times are sold out. So its a risk to try getting them at the window. We had requested our hotel manager to obtain... This is a must visit. Since Jolly Buoy is a protected island, the water here is as clear as glass. And the fishes!!! amazing..I had never witnessed such a sight before. Fishes of all shapes and sizes and colours swimming past you. An unforgettable experience. 

It is better to visit Jolly Buoy before you move on to Havelock or any other island. The snorkelling here is much better than any other place. Also each person has one guide who takes an effort to tell you the name of every fish and coral which you come across. We did scuba at Havelock after Jolly Buoy. but during scuba the instructor cannot tell you the names or descriptions of the sights you see. Because I had prior knowlege obtained during Jolly Buoy sightseeing, I enjoyed scuba because I knew what i was seeing and could appreciate the same.

We had requested our hotel manager to obtain the tickets for us beforehand.

You have to submit identity proof at the time of purchase and while boarding. 

You need to carry snacks and water since nothing is available on the island. But one request please, as the board on the island states that "" Leave back nothing but your footprints"", please carry the garbage, plastic wrappers back with you. 

It was heart wrenching to see a family discard cold drinks cans after drinking on the beach and a young couple leaving behind packs of frooti and wrappers of wafers on the island . This same couple and family when they will travel to the nearby malaysia or thailand will not dare do such a thing. Why is our country officially regarded as a open garbage bin by our very own and even so called ""Educated people"". The adminstration alone cannot do this. We as tourists also have to help.

The water was very very salty. It helps you to float on water easily, who cannot swim too can easily float on water which is a nice thing from my point of view. Please take good amount of cash with you whenever you are not on port Blair island because many islands do not have any or few ATMs. Jollybuoy do not have any residents living on the island and that's why they don't have any facility on this island.",Feb-16

"A wonderful experience, highly recommended",Sachin P,"Bangalore, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,08-Mar-16,"Jolly Buoy island offers some thing unique to the traveller. That is to see a different form of sea life. Many of the travellers would have done trips on boats and ships, across rivers and the seas. Jolly Buoy island uniqueness lies in the coral reefs present in its vicinity, and the amazing and colourful types of corals and the variety of fishes which exist around these corals. Fishes which many of us have seen only in acquariums can be seen in more lively and natural surroundings here. The journey to this island starts from the jetty near the Wandoor beach. The area is an eco-friendly zone, and this brings in some restrictions on the traveller. Plastic items are to be avoided. The A&N Tourism authorities seems to focus on plastic bottles and the plastic covers (used to wrap home made snacks etc.) than on bigger containers (like Tupperware bowls etc.). The authorities provides water containers (Rs.5 per container, and Rs.200 as refundable deposit), in which the tourist can stock up the water required. The journey is by a motor launch which takes around 40mins to reach Jolly Buoy. A smaller boat with glass floorings gets towed by the motor launch. Jolly Buoy island is uninhabited and only day time tourism is allowed out there. At the island I did find a shack erected by a cooperative society which was to sell snacks and light refreshments.

Jolly Buoy island is uninhabited and only day time tourism is allowed out there. At the island I did find a shack erected by a cooperative society which was to sell snacks and light refreshments. I visited the place on a Sunday, and it was not operational. This also gave me a feeling that the restrictions on carrying own food etc. also ensured that the refreshments shack got a good deal of business. 

Jolly Buoy offers two more attractions - snorkelling & viewing the sea life from the glass-floored boat. Rs.300 for 15 mins of snorkelling and Rs.600 for a 45 mins trip on the glass-floored boat. The boat ride is worth the money paid for. As the boat moves on, through the glass floor the corals and the water bodies can be clearly seen. The crew also are good guides who explains each and every type of coral and fish. For a person who has only seen such things in an artifical acquarium, this would for sure change his perspective. 

I travelled with a two your old kid, and she was able to cope up with the boat ride as well as the 3 hour stay at Jolly Buoy. The island has some greenery around, and in it are also some shacks/shanties setup for the tourists to relax. There are also toilets for ladies and changing rooms for men and women. The water available at the toilets are limited so this may cause problems to the women. The island does not have any electricity, nor any piping to fill the water tanks automatically. Sea water is carried bucket by bucket to fill the tank. A very old man was the staff allotted to fill up the water tank (used in the toilets) and some of the lady tourists had complained that he was asking for tips etc. to keep the tank filled.

This island is open for the tourist between October to April.. and for the rest of the months, tourists can visit the Redskin island, which is again under the same national park (This is done for the restoration and maintenance of both the islands). The Jetty for the Mahatma Gandhi National Park can be reached by Buses plying from Port Blair or by Tourist cars. The security checking here are pretty tough and you wont be allowed to take any plastic bags, water bottle or any sort of pollutant which may affect the marine life there if left behind. Also, make sure to keep your I-Card handy.

Number of visitors are limited and applying for permit before hand is advised.

I was somewhat disappointed with the place in the end. First thing, it takes quite some time to reach here. It is far away from Port blair city and takes more than an hour to reach the boarding point (Wandoor). Then you have to get in a long queue for a govt ferry. After all this, the ferry itself takes quite some time in reaching the Jolly Buoy island. There are a number of restrictions on what you can take there. No food. No plastic. And when you reach there, you can only roam around in a very small area. Rest of the area is barred for visitors.

Never Seen Better Corals and Cleaner Beach in India,akunalslife,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,23-Jan-16,"This Island had the ""Clean India Initiative"" years ahead of the rest of the country. 

Three things about this Island: 
1. Never seen as clear water as here 
2. Really Safe Beach as restricted crowd is allowed 
3. Really Clean Beach with strict staff 
4. Will not see better corals

Best viewed corals and pearls,tanumoyghosh,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,15-Jan-16,"Among all the island I have visited, Jolly Buoy experienced me with the best view of corals and pearls. 
However you need to get a permit to visit this island, so get it done well in advance and don't keep it pending to be done on the same day morning. 
The ship in which we have visited to jolly Buoy has a package included to show the various fishes via Glass Bottom Ride. However, you can pay more to go more deeper and to see some more under-water experience. 
You should go for snorkelling over there which is for 300, 500 and 1000. I have done for 500 which really worthy with the under-water scenes that I have experienced. 
The water over there is deep but waves are not that high, so you may also go for swimming within an area boundary.

The guides (boat men) fleece you with charges. even if you want to go on your own and yu have all the equipment you still need to go with them. 
they are hand in glove with the government people and the guy who comes as security. they say the guides are trained, but actually, they step on all the coral and show you. they even pick up starfish etc and give in your hand which is the worst thing we could do. but as usual, it is govt. organised so no training no education. they, in fact, ask you to touch the coral and disturb the fish. which I feel should never be allowed.

Plan. Planning a vacation in Andaman Islands (hub being Port Blair) required communicating with individuals at Port Blair (PB) where at times communications were inconsistent.

2. Cleanliness. An interesting fact that we witnessed was that all beaches and areas outside PB is litter free. No plastic or any litter was observed. Suitable disposable containers were around for disposing litter. As a result the beaches were beautiful soft clean sand were all around. PB is a different story but cleanliness was noticeable. 

3. Eateries. Apart from PB, eateries were simple and few. For example early morning convoy assembly point had roadside simple stalls serving Idli and Vada plus coffee/ tea. Whether we ate at Havelock or Wandoor eateries, the fare normally comprised Fish Rice some vegetable curry and lentil. Bottled water is available. Costs you could average at Rs 120 – Rs 150 /- per head. PB is a different story where more varieties are available. To estimate costing one could plan Rs 500/- to 800/- per head per day depending on taste and ambience. It must be remembered that on an average the cost of items are generally 30% higher than mainland. 

4. Accommodation. Sufficient accommodation both at PB and Havelock is available to suit different tastes ranging from Rs 2500/- to Rs 15000/- per night for double bed. It would be prudent to latch on to a tour operator and plan accordingly. Rains could never be predicted however a spell would last 30 minutes down pour generally in the evening / night. 

5. Interesting. We found the visit to Cellular jail, Marine Museum, Catamaran Makruzz ride to Havelock, Anthropological museum, corals and colourful fishes, litter free beaches at Havelock and Chidiyatapu and the limestone cave at Baratang plus the convoy ride through jungle while also fortunate to see a few aborigines and their thatched huts along our road. Overall a good outing for a week costing us besides air fare and accommodation cum meals at PB was Rs 28000/- (includes all ticketing / approvals and permissions) just for a week’s tour by road cum boat.

0600 – By hired transport proceed Phoenix Bay for Catamaran (named Makruzz) Ferry to Havelock Island. Cost of ticket Rs 3450/- per head. It was a comfortable ride in AC comfort to Havelock Island. Upon landing there your operator should have organized hired AC transportation to visit Kalapathar beach and Radhanagar beach. Lunch could be had at one of the eateries, depending upon your palate. I would recommend Sree Hari a simple eatery but good food was served. Cost Rs 200/- per head. The beaches and sands were a sight at both beaches. The waves rolling periodically gave a beautiful sight. Those interested for additional underwater sports would require staying the night in a suitable accommodation on Havelock Island.

Upon arrival at Baratang you need to disembark from transport and catch a vehicle ferry which carries you across to the other side where your operator should have made arrangement for a speed boat to convey you to the limestone cave which is hidden in between mangrove. Your boat will convey you to landing spot where your boat operator will double up as guide and a walk of about 3 Km undulating path to limestone cave entrance.

A heaven for Marine Ecosystem Lover..!!,ghumm0andaman,"Port Blair, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,18-Nov-15,"Jollybouy Island, situated in the Mahatma Gandhi Marine National Park is at a sailing distance of 2 Hrs from Wandoor Jetty. 

The island is an excellent snorkeling destination with a very rich underwater life and the activity is done under proper guidance and safety. 

The islands needs a special forest Permit which can be obtained a day before from the Forest Counter in the Tourism Department office near the High Court building. The permit cost somewhere around Rs.50/- and the boat fare is about Rs.750/- Per Head. To attain the permit one should apply with the ID proofs of the visiting travelers. This is sometimes a tedious work for travelers can outsource the tickets to agents. They charge around Rs.100/- per ticket. 

Also, the ticket & permit can be taken on same day at the Wandoor Jetty too but the numbers are very less, hence the chance too. 

So i would suggest if possible make a prior arrangement for the trip. 

Note: No snacks counter so please take some refreshment but request you to keep the island clean. More",Nov-15

Entire beach is extremely clean. I did snorkeling and scuba at 5 different islands in Andaman and found that surprisingly this one has best marine life. Very colorful corals with very good visibility inside water. 
The only flaw is the jetty that operates to bring people from Port Blair to this island. That boat was old and very unsafe. All the safety jackets were torn off and very dirty. 

If you can bear 45 mins of this boat, it is worth to go this island. 

It is clean and wish it will remain like that. More",Dec-14

A Great Place for Snorkelling/ Diving Enthisiasts,Satsmalloo,"Bangalore District, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,18-Oct-15,"Jolly Buoy Island is one of the best snorkelling and diving spots in Port Blair. It can be reached by a 45 min boat ride from Wandoor National Park. The island has shallow waters with corals for about 60 - 70 mtrs. Thereafter, the ocean floor falls to several hundred feet. There are glass bottom boats that provide a glimpse of the corals in shallow waters. One can snorkel in the shallow areas (or along the drop, if confident). For the accomplished swimmers, the free dive along the face of the sheer drop is a great experience.",Sep-15
"An interesting day out, grilled fish, some diving, and generally having fun on the water.",AlexanderF670,"Kingston, Canada",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,17-Oct-15,"I went as part of a group to jolly Buoy island, most of the group were there to do a try dive. A few of us were more experienced divers and wanted to do two good dives. The first dive we did from the shore was adequate, the kit was good, the instructors were competent and fun, but the visibility was poor. after a longish wait we went out on the boar in the late afternoon and conducted a shallow ( 10m) but rather wonderful dive. One felt as though no-one had ever ben diving here before, we saw some fish, a turtle, but mostly a collection of excellent corals and nudibranchs coming out in their full UV splendour. Would I go back- perhaps, but I think there are better dive set ups in Port Havelock. If you want a taste of diving this is a simple and easy way to conduct a try dive. Overall a good experience, and good value for money. More",Sep-15

The water over here so clear that almost everytng can be seen from top of the water only. Coral density and also variety of fish over here is very large as it is an undisturbed area except morning till late afternoon when travelers are allowed. After that no one is permitted to stay.

Nice experience but expensive!,Harshita C,jaipur,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,11-Jun-15,"Make no mistake Jolly buoy is a pristine island with white sands and heavenly green waters! But the only water activity available is snorkeling which is priced between 800-1500 which is unnecessarily expensive for a short ride. 

Adding the expense of the ferry ride, it can be a little less value for money especially since beaches on Havelock are all as good as Jolly buoy hence it might be an unnecessary add on to itinerary, and can be skipped. I would rather suggest spending as much time in Havelock than here! 

Though discounting the expense part, it was a great experience, especially since its completely non commercial and has no shops or resorts of any kind. The beach and waves are beautiful and it was a memorable experience for us :) More",Mar-15
Pristine clear beach with corals,Jeyasudharsan,"Madurai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,08-Jun-15,"Jolly buoy island is very famous for under water corals and the pristine clear beach. This place is one hour journey from Wandoor beach. Snorkeling and scuba diving are available here. 
This is located in Mahatma Gandhi National Marine Park, 30 Kms from Port Blair by road. Jolly buoy island will not be opened throughout the year as it is protected for live corals. 
The normal time leaving to Jolly buoy island is 9.00am. All the ships leave at the same time and come back together at 2.00pm. 
As a standard trip, while getting down from the ship and transferring to the island through small boats, visitors will be taken through a complementary ride and will be shown these under water corals through glass bottom. This is for only a very short duration (10 minutes). People willing to see more of these can hire a boat independently and enjoy by paying extra amount. Additional amount has to be paid also for snorkeling and scuba diving. We can see more spices in snorkeling since they are highly protected here.

We also saw a large monitor at the island. The waters are just crystal clear and efforts have been taken to preserve and protect the natural beauty of the place. The three coral reefs and the variety of marine life that we saw from the glass boat was an experience that everyone should experience. 
The sad part is the state of the Public convenience. In fact its to do with the tourists coming to this island. More efforts and strictness needs to be put in here. Change rooms are too stinky and lack of amenities leads to ugly trash thrown around them. Actually didn't feel like getting into the waters after seeing the condition in and around the change rooms.

Wonderful Place,Gaurav_Upadhyaya,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,14-May-15,"A must have if you are at Port Blair. TO reach from Port Blair you need to go by road for around 40 KM to reach to Wandoor and then take a Ferry to reach out to Jolly Bay. You would need to take a permit to reach out to Jolly bay. Talk to your hotel before reaching if they can assist in getting the permit for you. Else your Option is to go very early in the morning and get into the Queue for the permit. 
The place has clear water with lovely corals and sea life to see with options of snorkelling if you can learn to breathe through the kit and for the less adventurous ones there is a Glass bottom boat ride to see them from to which is a must do if not doing snorkelling. 
I have been to Elephant Beach and done snorkelling & Sea Walk there, but appreciated the snorkelling at Jolly bay much more than that. Of Course the top one was the Scuba diving at Havelock. 
In all a must place to visit if in Port Blair.

The boat man told us the names of each of the animals we watched like crump shell, parrot fish, pink star fish, blue star fish,sand fish, finger corals, builder corals and many more. 

I believe this island is less explored so marine life is less disturbed so far.

Water is constantly thrown over it to keep the dust away. With no cover, sun on top, one sees suns reflection. Further at the depth of not more than 1 to 2 meters, what one sees are mostly dead corals. Hardly any color. A few fish. That's all. We paid for 45 minutes ride additionally.

Well worth the time and money,AjLud,"Coonoor, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,01-Mar-15,"The trip to Jolly Boys (now distorted to Jolly Buoy) Islands is a 45-min boat trip from Wandoor. The boat-trip, through the narrow straights between islands in the Mahatma Gandhi Marine National Park (past Alexandra, Holiday and Rutland) is breathtaking in itself. 

The last-bit after the larger boat can go no more is done in small motor-boats, upto 8 passengers at a time. These conveniently have glass-bottoms, so one has a clear view (sun-rays permitting) of coral below the water-surface. 

The beach at Jolly Boys is coarse coral-dust (it hurts). The water is pristine, from emerald to turquoise as it deepens. The sea is not reliable. Being placed towards the open sea on the west-end of the archipelago, only the inner portions of the sea are swimmable. On the outer side, the currents can be dangerous. 

One can stay behind for a second boat to pick you up, but is not advisable - the boat may be cancelled for want of passengers. 

There is no organised retail - carry your own water and food. 

Do be gracious enough not to litter - there are no janitors to clean up after you. 

Trips to this group is alternated with the visit to Red-Skin island on different dates. You cant always expect to visit Jolly Boys - that day might be the RedSkin ferry! Check before you leave for Wandoor. More",Mar-14

From Port Blair, you need to drive about 45 minutes in the morning (30Km) to reach there by 9.00AM. You need to carry water flasks (plastic bottles are banned in the boat) or you can hire them by paying a charge of 5 per bottle (though you have to give a deposit of 200 per bottle which is returnable). Carry sufficient amount of food and water as nothing is available in the island. The boat ride is about 1 hour and you will proceed in terms of the line you stand. Typically there are 4 boats which travel to Jolly Buoy on daily basis (one after another) taking about 50 tourists in each one. Life Jackets area available and must be put on. Once you reach the place, the guys take you in a glass bottom boat for a complimentary 10 minutes trip to showcase the marine life but they move so fast that you can not see much. However, they will tell you that if you want to see the marine life properly, you need to go to three zones for a 30 minutes ride and each zone costs 200 per person but if you decide to take all three zones, they will charge 400 per person instead of 600.

After the coral trip, you can choose to do snorkeling (300 per a small trip and then 500 for little more and 1000 for a full trip per person) but the same is worth. After doing all these activities, you can simply swim for some time in the pleasant emerald water slowly splashing your body. You need to carry extra cloth and preferably put on a floater kind of shoe which can be easily taken out as you need to get into water to come out of the boats.

Try to get an agent to get you the permit and ferry tickets to the Island before your arrival to Port Blair. There are limited ferries which go to the Island. They leave around 8:30AM and get you back around 4:00PM. Try to take a picnic lunch with no plastic bags as they are not allowed on the Island. Plastic bottles are not allowed either but you can rent Milton water bottles. The ferry ticket includes a 15 minute glass bottom boat ride which is ok. The water is gorgeous and quite calm. Snorkeling is highly recommended. Though the reefs are not very extensive you can see many different types of corals and other sea life. More,Dec-14

The boat ride to get to the island is slow and the life jackets that we were required to wear were moldy and stank. I think they were never rinsed off with clean water. When we got to the island, we were only allowed to swim in a very small area where 200 other people were swimming. And this was for ""safety"" we were assured. However, the boat organizers drove their boats right past the rope where small children were swimming and almost ran over them. Snorkeling anywhere is not allowed unless you purchase a tour or a glass bottom boar rides. We were also not allowed to walk on the beach past the red flags which are roughly 1/4 mile apart.

A Perfect mix of Leisure and Activity,korebio,"Calcutta, West Bengal, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,02-Aug-14,"Jolly Buoy is a small inhabitant island which is a must visit place, the reason being you can enjoy this island in both ways i.e. by spending leisure hours by the sea watching its spectacular view or by indulging yourself in water sport activities like snorkeling or watching marine life through glass bottom boat. In order to visit Jolly Buoy, you have to take ticket from Wandoor National park or from Port Blair at least a day before. Wandoor is the place from where Ferries for Jolly Buoy depart and it's a 2hr journey from Port Blair. On the other hand, just beside the anthropological museum of Port Blair, there is a ticket counter which will give you confirm booking for Jolly Buoy.

Plastic is completely banned in Jolly Buoy. There is a housekeeper in the island who takes care of all these. If anybody pollutes the island, he will literally shout at them. If anyone did it avoiding his notice, then he is kind enough to collect those garbage and drop those in his sack. There is shifting duty of housekeepers who try at their level best to keep the island entirely pollution free and clean. You will not be allowed to carry water bottles if they are made up of plastic and at the counter you can get bottle for hire if you don't carry any plastic bottle. 
The journey to Jolly Buoy is though mangroves and it's truly a journey you will cherish forever. Upon reaching there you can go for snorkeling or glass bottom boat or both or you can just enjoy the sea by relaxing near the beach. On one of our visits, we spotted snake in the sea. The color combination of the sea is quite marvelous but the weather has to be clear. If it becomes cloudy then your visit is a ruin. There are literally three colors of the water and these are normal transparent water, emerald blue and deep blue(Please see my pics for better understanding and keep in mind they are not Photoshopped). The ferry will allow you 2 hour at the island and you can freely roam about. There is no provision for food and water on the island so better you carry it and have it on the journey itself. Upon arriving on the island, just enjoy its serene beauty. Collecting shell from the beach is strictly prohibited but yes, you can always collect unless get caught. 

The island is very tiny so you can easily roam about the whole island within half an hour so I would suggest go for a snorkeling here as I found this is the best snorkeling spot among all four i.e. North Bay(port Blair), Jolly Buoy, Bharatpur(Neil island) and Elephant Bay Beach(Havelock). The marine life is quite rich here and the stream current is quite strong here so it will be a good exercise. If you are afraid of snorkeling then go for glass bottom boat where also you can find a rich underwater flora and fauna. Ask for the boatman to take into a deeper sea for some extra cash, I guarantee you will not regret. More",Feb-14

You are not allowed to carry any kind of plastic. You have to get thermos bottles on rent or your own Tupperware bottles to carry your own water, before you board the boat that takes you to Jolly Bouy. It is a 20-30 minute ride. 
There is wide diversity of corals, fishes and other sea animals, which you get to see during the Snorkeling session. Bottom glass ride is not very good, since the boats are not covered and the glass reflection inhibits views inside water.

Amazingly beautiful Island in heavenly pristine waters,trotter_abhi,"Seattle, Washington",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,26-Jan-14,"Forest department at Port Blair issues limited permits per day which can be taken one day in advance before visiting this Island. Boats leave early in the morning starting at 8 AM, and tourists get to spend around 2-3 hours before coming back. 

The permits can be taken directly at the Wandoor jetty in low tourist seasons. But, it is advisable to take it in advance to avoid any last moment disappointment. 

The Island is opened for around 6 months per year starting from November. At other times in the year, tourists are taken to Red Skin Island. 

The Island is amazingly beautiful with turquoise pristine waters surrounding it. You can see colors of waters changing shade around the Island, and enhances the beauty of the place many folds. 

The beach has waist high water till a distance and one can enjoy swimming in these waters without much trouble. 

The ferry trip from the Wandoor jetty includes a glass bottom boat ride and a Snorkeling trip. You can pay little extra per head for an extended ride in the glass bottom boat or for snorkeling. The marine life and corals at this place are simply superb and should not be missed. You can pick either one of the two activities as per your needs and requirements and enjoy the marine life.

It is a beautiful scene of a coral world lit by the sun rays that filter through crystal clear waters. The variety of fish seen, the dull to the brilliantly colored, some cute and slim, some intimidating, some in shimmering groups, some loners - no museum visit is a substitute for this experience, which is also an eye-opener to the amazing biodiversity hidden under the waters that cover 72% of earth’s surface. 

Jolly Buoy is plastic-free and junk-free, thanks to sensible and simple restrictions well enforced. Before boarding the boat at Wandoor, passengers have to declare the plastic bottles they carry, and have to pay a deposit, which can be claimed on showing the bottles while returning. There are no stalls in the island. In the last boat leaving Jolly Buoy will be the lone police woman and an old man who collects all the garbage of the day in a sack.

Understand - 
Jolly Buoy is one of the 15 islands comprising the Mahatama Gandhi Marine National Park. It is open 6 months a year. 

How to reach and get back - 
1. From Port Blair, one has to first one has to reach Wandoor (29 km, 1 hour) by road. From Wandoor, you have to catch the Jetty/Ferry to reach Jolly Buoy Island which will take another hour. 
2. Boat ticket from Wandoor to Jolly Buoy and permit to enter Jolly Buoy should be taken 1 day in advance from Port Blair itself. As of 2014, the charges are Rs 900 (850 Rs. Ferry Ticket + 50 Rs. permit) per person. This can be arranged via any tour operators in Port Blair with no additional charges (i.e at Rs 900 itself) 
3. Port Blair to Wandoor - The best and cheapest way to reach Wandoor is by the government run STS bus from the Port Blair Bus Terminal (situated within the main market of the city, Aberdeen Bazar). It is a one hour ride. (Unlike other Indian cities, the government buses are clean, uncrowded, punctual-to-the minute and reliable). On the way, you can see Sippighat agricultural farm, which is a tourist destination in itself. Catch the 7.30 am Bus so you can reach Wandoor by 8.30 am. An alternate way to reach Wandoor is to book a private return taxi from Port Blair which will cost around 2400 Rs. 
4. From Wandoor, ferries start departing from 9 am onward and depart at 15 min. interval till 10.15 am. After that you will not get any ferry. The ferry ride is quite enjoyable because your are allowed to go on the upper deck. 
5. Return ferries will Depart at 2 pm. Once you reach back Wandoor, you can go to see the Wandoor Beach (5 min. walk) or catch the return bus for Port Blair. The last return bus departs at 5.15 pm. 

Do - 
1. As mentioned earlier, it is the best spot for Snorkeling. The Marine Life (corals as well as fishes) is simply amazing and the best in Andaman Islands. The guides are also fairly knowledgeable and helpful. The rates for Snorkeling are 500 Rs (for shorter duration) or 1000 Rs (for longer route, more duration, 25 min. approx). No knowledge of swimming is required for Snorkeling. 
2. Those afraid of water can opt for glass bottom ride (available in 300 Rs and 500 Rs). A demo ride will be provided for free (inclusive in ferry ticket) when you reach Jolly Buoy. For anyone who is going to do Snorkeling, the glass bottom ride is not worth doing. 
3. There are changing rooms and shades provided to tourists for relaxing. 
4. The Water quality (clarity, visibility) is the best I have seen in India. 
5. The beach is good, location is quite scenic and well maintained. Plastics are not allowed on the island. 
6. DO NOT FORGET TO TAKE LUNCH/PACKED FOOD ALONG WITH YOU. You won't find anything to eat on the Island as it is part of a National Park and any temporary or permanent construction is forbidden on the island. More",Dec-13

Go for it and you wont repent the live aquarium experience. 

But beware... this is a no plastic island. Carry water and food with you as there's nothing available in the island. Dont forget to dump your leftovers in the dustbins or to face fine. The authority is very very strict on this island.

Swimming person shouldn't go with any guide for snorkeling, please bring a mask and do snorkeling by yourself, that is the best way to browse. it is totally safe place, you will find so many live coral here...and one more thing don't go for glass boat by extra pay, whatever you have in your package that is enough, if you are not swimmer then you can go for snorkeling by extra pay only.

Dont's: 

Do not carry plastic bags or bottles (at the jetty, forest dept will give you water bottles after submitting refundable security deposit). 
Do not go too far in the sea. it is dangerous.

"Worth a trip, but still overrated. Poorly conducted trips.",KumarRUSA,"San Francisco, California",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,15-Jun-13,"The only reason I gave this a 2 star review of ""Poor"" instead of a 1 star review of ""Terrible"" is because I respect the fact that the authorities do not allow plastic and other inorganic products to be brought onto the island. For this reason, the place has remained clean. Otherwise you can rest assure, people would find a way to trash the place. Now, let me explain my issues with this place - 1. First off, the boats to get here from Wandoor are completely organized. Like everywhere else in India, it is complete chaos. There's no clear system of getting people on the boards and so it becomes a free for all pushing and shoving competition. Not cool, fix that up.

For this reason, the place has remained clean. Otherwise you can rest assure, people would find a way to trash the place. 

Now, let me explain my issues with this place - 

1. First off, the boats to get here from Wandoor are completely organized. Like everywhere else in India, it is complete chaos. There's no clear system of getting people on the boards and so it becomes a free for all pushing and shoving competition. Not cool, fix that up. I was ashamed to see the uncivilized behavior of dozens of people - from all age groups. 

2. The people operating the boats and then the excursions on the island have zero knowledge of English. For me this was not an issue. There was one foreign couple on the boat and for them it was a problem. I did not have a chance to speak with them until our return, otherwise I would have been happy to help them out. As the Andamans popularity grows, more foreigners will come. There some at least be someone with some knowledge of English. It's the worldwide medium of communication. 

3. You can go for both a glass-bottom boat ride and also snorkeling while on the island. Due to the crowds of people, each boat is filled to the brim and people are only given a 5 minute ""preview"" after which they can pay for a longer time. It's a rip-off. Get on the boat as soon as you reach the island to get your ""free"" trip in, otherwise you won't get a chance. 

4. The coral is mostly dead near shore. Why? Because people touch the coral and also step on it. It's a living organism, not a rock. The authorities should have educated people about this from the beginning. Such a good job of preventing trash, only to allow the marine life to get destroyed. 

5. Continuing on from #4, there are way too many people on the island at one time. They should cut the number by 50-75%. It will create a better experience for all, even though less profit will be earned. 

6. One of the island cleaners/care takers stopped me from making a circle around the island, saying I wouldn't hear them calling for us to board the boat to return. That is complete non-sense as a walk-around would only take 5 minutes at most, and I tried to do this at the start of the trip. You have 2-3 hours there from what I recall. The island is small, be persistent if they try to stop you. I'm an environmental protection freak, nothing will be damaged that already isn't. 

Overall it's worth the trip despite my negative review. I would actually rate it above Havelock Island. I just feel that the authorities who organize and allow for this trip could do a much better job. 

Lastly, plan on spending your entire day to complete this tour - from morning til evening. 

Wandoor village has food/refreshments. You can get free bottles for pouring your drink(s) in when purchasing your entry ticket. You must return them on arrival, and only those bottles provided by the authorities are allowed. More",Feb-13

Actually this island is very beautiful. Excellent clear water. We just loved the color of the water. The corals and fishes are also excellent here. We explored the Corals and Fishes by doing Snorkeling here. 

You need to get permission one day advance to go to this island. It will cost Rs. 750.00 per head. (Rs. 650.00 for both-way ferry ticket and Rs. 100.00 for permit). This cost includes one free snorkeling.

1 hour boring ride on a ship to jolly buoy. 

Getting cheated by govt. person appointed to give me ""snorkelling trailer"" by his words included in my 650 Rs Package. 

Next thing he ignores this trailer for everybody and offers them Rs. 500 per person for snorkelling. Especially to those people without snorkels or goggles. 

So basically I did not get my snorkelling and I should sue them for this, but anyway. 

Cheats are running the show here. But in the end it was not a waste. I'll tell you how. 

My Brother and I had our own snorkels and mask plus the corals were very near to the beach. So we saw the corals and fishes on our own. The govt guy ( MANOJ { mr. cheat }) got stumped by us actually. 

So i advise: 

Take your Snorkels and Masks to Andamans. 

The current at Jolly Buoy is sometimes very strong. So be a good swimmer first. 

Talk rudely to idiots like Manoj who are supposed to give you in their words snorkelling ''trailers"" but are more interested in selling their own trips. 

The fishes are amazing and they actually come till the beach and play with you. So atleast take swimming goggles along. 

Corals are nearby, so if you're a good swimmer take your snorkels.

1. Crystal clear water which is hard to find on Indian mainland's beaches. 
2. Our first snorkeling (10 minutes snorkeling was free with ticket). Mostly people pay extra to spend more time for snorkeling which is worth it.

This is the must Visit place if you are visiting Andaman.

Can visit depending on your overall Andaman itinerary,ShareKhan4,"Sydney, Australia",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,19-Feb-13,"I see there are broadly two types of visitors to the Andamans.

You then get into what feels like a crowded boat with a capacity around 40 people and cruise into the park. Scenery is nice, but nothing extraordinary, though by time, about 10000 pictures would have been clicked by your fellow boat mates. 

After around an hour, you reach Jolly Buoy Island. It looks nice, with clear water around it. Your boat is likely to have a smaller glass-bottomed boat attached. You get out, about 14 at a time, into the glass-bottomed boat and view coral and fish as you slowly head to the beach. Pretty decent stuff. 

The ""guides"" from your boat will later take people, 2-3 at a time, into the sea for about 50 meters, about 15 minutes, for snorkelling. You are assumed to be a novice and use a tube float and a face mask, while the ""guide"" uses fins and pulls you along. 

The coral was okay, nothing extraordinary and most of the coral is bleached or dead here (as is most in the region due to the bleaching of coral due to warm temperatures, which peaked in May 2010). I found that the coral and fish at Inglis Island much much better. And I heard that those off South Button were also pretty good. 

Here, you're going to meet a lot of nice uncles and aunties. Many of the uncles will go swimming in their underwear. And roam around the island after they are wet. Especially the old men. Rather disgusting.

So Natue lovers tighten up for a visit to Andman that will include snorkeling at Jolly buoy island and Glassbottom ride also there. 
My personal view is that you must carry your own snorkeling gear that will be more helpful. 
And yes, while at Andaman DO NOT TAKE JET SKI it is more cheaper and better at GOA.

So first thing go and see the lovely Marine Centre and the movie also that they show in AC that will put PVR Cinema to shame. 

Carry food cause once you go to Jolly Bouy Island you'll know what Robinson Cruzo felt. There is a heavy fine for littering and theres also a guy spying on you.

The ferry stops at a distance from the island, as the coral reefs would be destroyed by the ferry. Hence, there are small glass bottom boats which would take you till the shore. The island has a virgin white sand beach with lot of greenery around. There are makeshift arrangement for changing rooms and toilets which are unfortunately not clean. There is also some place to sit under the shade. 
The best part of Jolly Buoy is its corals and sea life. Having tried glass bottom boat rides at Elephanta and Neil island, scuba diving at havelock, we concluded that Jolly Buoy is the best place for snorkeling/glass bottom boat ride. There is a complimentary snorkeling trip included in the ferry ride, but it is better if you pay extra and go as far as possible. We could see fishes of all possible colors like Finding Nemo, Tiger fish etc.... we touched a star fish, sea cucumber, saw all types of corals and it was sheer bliss. The water is crystal clear and the marine life is so vibrant, it is a must for everyone to experience this beauty. Snorkeling is mush easier than scuba as you donot have to go under water, also there will be a guide with you all the time identifying the fishes or corals for you. The only problem was with the snorkeling gears which were dirty and broken. So it is better to carry your own gear when you visit the Andamans, as you would get a chance to snorkel almost everywhere. Those who donot wish to snorkel can go for a glass bottom boat ride and clearly see the marine life. 
We paid Rs300 pp for snorkelling and Rs200 pp for glass bottom boat.

not so lesser known anymore,Akashneel,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,21-Jun-12,"if you can endure swarms of budget tourists jostling for space in the creaky boats, smell of kerosene for an hour and back (to and fro wandoor jetty), hunger from 9.00 am to 2.30 pm- a trip to Jolly Buoy is worth it. paltry discounts you need to make for a dekko at some of the most astonishing marine life you'll come across. snorkelling here is a must. 

a small tip, though your boat tickets from wandoor covers a free 5 minute snorkelling exercise and a glass boat ride to the shore, that's not the real thing. ask any of the locals on the boat for an additional snorkelling experience (ranging between 30 mins to an hour, 200 rs to 1000 rs) where they take you further to see the real thing. a half day trip from port blair that's really worth it. and you'll be back just in time to witness the light and sound show at the cellular jail More",Apr-12

Jolly Good Buoy,Vamsi N,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,03-May-12,"Well my first experience of Snorkelling happened at Jolly Buoy, so it will always have a special place for me. But what I heard from people is that after the tsunami of 2004, it is now half as good as it was prior to that. But I felt, for a first timer, it was good enough. I had fun snorkeling and playing around in the water with my son. But if one has the scope and time and budget, as per the popular suggestion, they should go to elephant beach in havelock instead of Jolly Buoy. 

There are a couple of other factors going against Jolly Buoy: 
1. the distance from Port Blair Main city. 35 kms 
2. The slow ferry ride on the sea on outdated and exhausted ferries. 

One suggestion is that if you are not looking at snorkelling, then avoid Jolly Buoy, its not worth the effort going all the way there just to splash in the water on the beach. 

From what i saw , in a ferry that carried around 50 people only 3 - 4 people did snorkelling. Some go there pre-decided and some lose the nerve when it comes to actually doing it. But Jolly Buoy jaake snorkelling nahin kiya tho kya kiya. More",Apr-12

Wow!,Amitabha B,"Kanpur, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,15-Mar-12,"I had no idea that in India we have such a well preserved marine national park. The corals and the under-water world is just spectacular. Please go to this place first before the tour operators con you into going to North Bay. This is an infinite times better spot. This is an un-inhabitated island open only for 5-6 hours a day for visitors. The number of visitors is limited by the number of boats that can go there in a day. You will be able to enjoy nature away from the busy (and dirty) beach scene that greets you at North Bay. 

I am secretly doubtful about the star fish they show here. These do not look real. However, you must go for snorkeling here. You will love it. I went for two rounds. More",Mar-12
Best Island to visit for marine life. Do not miss this,priteshkulkarni,"Pune, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,03-Mar-12,"I was surprise rather shocked that there are no reviews about this island. From where I start……ok This is a small island and you can take boat from Wandoor jetty. Charges for to and fro ride is INR 550/- per person (it includes 1 snorkeling OR bottom glass boat ride nearby Jolly Bouy Island). Do not keep plastic bags as this island is No plastic zone. To carry water, there provide you water bags on INR 5/- rent and 100/- deposit. Boat ride take around 40-45 min to reach there. Because of rich corals, they shift you in small glass bottom boats and then you entered on the most beautiful Island. Very IMP is, carry some snacks as Island is under national Marine Park so no food stalls. Island is very clean and water is crystal clear. They offer you free snorkeling OR bottom glass boat ride. If you like it then you can pay extra INR for longer ride. We did snorkeling and free snorkeling was just a trailer of marine life. We like it so we paid INR 400/-extra per person and he took us for 20-25 min ride. This experience was simply amazing. We saw a lot of corals, different types of fishes and 2 octopuses. We witness Breath taking underwater view of coral and marine life. We loved so much that we did snorkeling 3 times. Those who are scared of snorkeling then enjoy glass boat...

Over hyped beach,KSNAR,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,01-Mar-19,"Route to Corbyn's Cove is delightful with hills on one side and sea on the other, with well painted railings and plenty of boats and steamers visible out in the bay. Unrestricted view of faraway islands from the cove is worth mentioning. 
Having said that, the beach, by itself, is not very good. You could do some photo shoots , but that is all you can do there. There are other beaches in Andamans that will overshadow this beach by an incredibly wide margin. 
Mobile network is extremely poor in this region, maybe due to hills on one side. 
Dropping this beach from travel itenary will not make much of a difference. 

Not recommended if you are on a tight time schedule. More",Feb-19

We had rented activa scooter from the local services beside our hotel and the ride to Corbyn's Cove beach took less than 30 minutes. The ride was refreshing and the drive along the beach line was one of a kind. It was amazing and sparsely crowded. Pros: Inside the city of Port Blair. Drive is amazing with lots of turns and cool breeze. Lot of beach side restaurants present and they keep playing songs on the sound box. This might seem like a nuisance for some people, but it does give a good ambience in the evening. Lot of Tender coconut vendors. Jet sky activity.(But I suggest you to do water sports in Islands with far better beaches and views). Life guard is present at all times. Lot of coconut trees and good view to take some really cool pictures for your trip. Cons: Not very clean. Not well maintained. Small beach. Not ample parking space available. The water sports vendors keep running behind tourists convincing them to use their services, which at times is irritating, but I suppose this is pretty much the scenario in the entire Andaman islands.

Me and my wife used to go there at around 10-11 pm in the night by two wheeler and never felt unsafe. When we visited there were no options to eat because of heavy rain and wind flow.

How To Reach: 

If you wish transportation can be arranged through your hotel or else you can go for auto rickshaw as well. It takes around 20 minutes from the city. 

Activities: 

You have some water sports activities like speed boat ride, jet ski etc. If you take a boat ride they will take you to the 'Snake Island' but you are not allowed to be on the island except a view from your boat keeping safe distance. As I heard this island is full of Snakes that's why nobody is allowed here. 

Food: 

Restaurants are available by the sea beach. You'll also find some temporary stalls for snacks, tea/coffee etc.

A beach in Port Blair,AbhishekKalra,"Hoboken, New Jersey",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,07-Dec-15,"One of the relatively less famous beaches in the Andaman's island. The beach is located in the capital city of Port Blair and pales in comparison to its better known sibling the Radhanagar Beach. 
However, to be fair the beach is primly maintained and is cleaner than the larger share of beaches on the Indian mainland. The beach is filled up with a large number of coconut tress giving it the quintessential beach feel and one can laze around on the large number of comfortable seating arrangements.It has a shack or two serving local cuisines. 

The place also has some sort of arrangement for water sports enthusiasts. It is however, advised to remain cautious while venturing into the waters at the beach as it has frequent warnings of saltwater crocodile sightings ( we had it twice during our visit). 

Bottom-line- Go out if you have a spare evening and relaxation is all you seek. More",Jan-15
Only beach of Port Blair,PKTMumbai,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,06-Dec-15,"Corbyn's cove has very good surroundings-- greenery on one side and expanse of blue water on the other side.

Walking around the waterline is very pleasant. Then there are stalls selling coconuts, tea and other trinkets. Nice to spend around 2-3 hours. A must in the itinerary at Port blair.

A standard tourist stop,Neofelis,"London, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,01-Dec-15,"Corbyn's Cove is perhaps Port Blair's most popular beach and hence a stop on every tourist's itinerary. The spot therefore is as expected quite crowded and full of people. 

There is a few water sports and boat rides on offer but honestly not much to write home about. It is worth a visit just to check off an item from the to do list there but not much more. 

Have a stroll along the beach and drink one of the rather large fresh coconuts. 

There is also the ruins of a Japanese bunker right there on the left side of the beach. But it is in quite a state of neglect as its foundations have been ripped out over time and rubbish has filled up inside. Just good to look at from the outside as a small piece of world war history. More",Dec-15

The beautiful blue ocean on your left, narrow winding hilly road, and the overall view takes your breath away! 
on the beach you can take a bath, indulge in some water sports or just lie down on the deck chairs put up there by an enterprising gentleman who charges Rs. 10/- per hour for a chair!!

Descent beach,gauth333,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,22-Nov-15,This is a nice beach in the city. It was raining when we went there notwithstanding that the atmosphere was good. A crocodile had been cited a day before due to which we were not allowed to venture into the sea. A part of a beach where a river meets the sea was not well maintained and there was litter every where. There were broken liquor bottles and stuff. In fact it was kinda dangerous venturing into that part of the beach. The shops on the beach sold pretty descent snacks. Over all you cant compare this beach to the rest of the great beaches at these islands however you can go to this place if there is nothing else to do in the evening. More,Oct-15

This falls under city tour. Nice curved beach and green coconut palms gives added flavor to the overall scenic beauty. One can skip this beach having tight schedule. 

One can see a nice sunset (I took few long exposure shots after sunset) and I overall enjoyed the beach. 

The best part of Andaman is anyone can hire a scooty for a day (price 400-500 INR) and travel on your own. You will enjoy the overall ride to the beach from City Center. 

There is a beach facing resort and a bar cum restaurant. So, you can also try staying there, if you wanna enjoy both the sunrise and sunset. 

Bathrooms and changing room available. Nice for several water activities. 

So, I would strongly recommend to visit this place, if you are staying Portblair for a couple of days. More",Oct-15

It was a bit cloudy hence we couldn't see the full fledged sunrise but this was a good start of out Andaman trip. Every morning around 7 AM, one can see groups of commandos warming up and exercising incessantly. We had to walk back from the beach for a distance since there was no auto, cab on the way and it was like those morning strolls along the sea coast with meandering roads getting lost somewhere, when finally after around 2 km we got a cab to hotel.

Blend of Adventure and Relaxation,Sukanya D,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,17-Oct-14,"The drive from Port Blair is lovely. We went in the evening so the sun was fading and pleasant, not scorching. The road is smooth and the local driver was good. We entered through one of the two side gates which many people had missed and they were standing outside the main gate. There is a notice board reminding people about Japanese occupation of these islands. Once inside, our group split into three groups. The first made a beeline for the sea and dived right in under watchful eye of some policemen (Cyclone Hudhud alert was on, so it is not known to me if they are posted here on a regular basis.) Later heard that there were changing rooms (payment required) and bathrooms for men and women (payment required...plus the ladies one had a LONG Queue it seems) but I did not see these. The men all changed outside because it would have taken all night for the tourists to have used the facility ! The second group made for the small stalls selling very basic, kitschy touristy junk such as hair clips and things made with sea shells etc. Top sellers were cloth caps decorated gaudily with ribbons and other rubbish at about Rs 100 or so because on beaches the sun can get really hot. Honestly, I wouldn't buy any of the tawdry stuff because anything with seashells etc., and without adequate proof of purchase is likely... The drive from Port Blair is lovely.

Honestly, I wouldn't buy any of the tawdry stuff because anything with seashells etc., and without adequate proof of purchase is likely to be seized at the airport. Besides these are badly made...the kind you cannot give away, hate to keep and feel sorry to throw away as it was never used. 
DONOT even pick up corals and dead sea shells (even pieces)...I feel the stuff seized at the airport can provide enough material to keep locals occupied in making stuff they sell INSIDE the airport!!! So, anyway DONOT collect anything from the beach...even kids are NOT ALLOWED to retain one measly bit of broken bivalve shell as a memento. There are 1-2 shops selling onion fritters etc, (pakoras) and a kulfi seller who honks to attract attention (this is a local version of an Indian ice cream. Hygiene is likely to be suspect.) I had visions of sea food or at least prawns being grilled on the beach....SADLY let down. 
The third group headed straight to the Pay and Use wooden loungers with adjustable back (Rs 10 for one hour...there is a lady in an apron who politely collects the cash...and makes rounds but don't fuss if anyone rests for a moment on the lounger...there is some grace here). I selected one. Got a tender coconut (Nariyal pani) Rs 20...(BEST BUY, ever) and sipped it while watching others roll with the waves or sit on the beach and let the water wash over them. The man who sells the coconut will also chop it open for you to eat the yummy soft semi-solid baby coconut flesh...you look up to see the coconut palms swaying and the sea breeze fans you gently....your eyes close....then you wake up as stray dogs get into a fight!!!!

The sea seemed to be a bit rough here as compared to other places but its beautiful nonetheless. 

Like almost everywhere in Andaman, the ride to this place from the heart of Port Blair is just breath-taking. 
You ride along the sea line, with occasional ascends and descends. Just don't get distracted and keep your eyes on the road. 
To enjoy, park in an empty area and soak-in the surrounding. 

The only thing I didnot like about this place is, there are very very few places where you can eat.

Some sort of opencast mining on the southern headland. Water quality pretty murky. 

Beach and water is clean from rubbish - saw a few guys walking along collecting trash. Quite a few people swimming - but assume the reef starts close to the waters edge as noticed many people wading rather gingerly. 

Jetski and speedboat rides available to the small island offshore.",Apr-14

Per head charges for this trip to Snake Island? Rs. 750!

True there is a beach (not too big) but the sea here looks like a big salt lake. The small and docile waves on the beach - most probably because of a number of islands around - were more like waves generated in big lakes / dams. There is rocky shore just around the beach so one cannot take a long walk without turning back. Yes there are water scooters and speed boats which can be used to have fun / approaching islands close by. The area around the beach is well maintained.

Corbyn's Cove is really really clean , and an effort has been made to keep it that way , which is nice to see. There are some tea stalls and small eats available along with the usual souvenir stalls. Boat rides are available to a tiny island a little distance from the coast .

This beach is set in picturesque backgrounds of lush green coconut palms.One of the most popular nearby attractions to Corbyn's Cove Beach are the Snake Islands, known for the amazing collection of some beautiful coral reefs. Water takes a different colour here.But its not a beautiful in comparison to other beaches over there.Beware of salt water crocodiles over here as they were last seen in the month of february(2012).There is nothing special on this beach to see so you can visit it in a small span of time.But the road to corbyn's cove beach is an awesome one.loved that drive.

A neat and clean ;almost plastic free; city across the Bay of Bengal . No mobile towers but BSNL mobile services are available almost everywhere through satellite. Port Blair can be reached either by ship or daily multiple & regular Air flights from Delhi , Kolcatta and Chennai . Air route is comfortable and very pleasing to eyes as plane goes over the sea and one can see different island of Andaman & Nichobar scattered- in pleasing to eye green/blue sea with cloud overhead .

People & tour operators are friendly ,honest and cooperative but the police specially on ATR route is most unfriendly and if one is travelling on ATR be prepared to meet unfriendly police who may force you to open the door of your vehicle and accommodate one of them in your private vehicle in name of protecting local tribal population. This action of police is laughable as evident from the recent video (exposures on TV channels )of tribal people dancing on the instructions and in presence of local police for the police & tourist 
Be aware of Jawar tribes on ATR route ;they may be dangers .To my utter surprise two of them whom we saw threatened us in good Hindi to “go fast” .The surprising part was their “Hindi” 
There are following places and attractions to visit with base in Port Blair point of attraction are : 
Celular Jail ;Light & sound show in the evening in side the celuar jail; Andaman water sports complex Sawmill(more than 125 years old and fully mechanized & although located on a different Island but connected by a motor-able bridge ; Samudrika ,Anthropological museum, Fisheries Museum ,and Carbyns cove beach . 
There are many other attraction around to visit on different islands . Radhanagar and elephant beach on Havelok island , and on the way to elephant beach enjoy beautiful Mangroves creeks (group and rows of plants almost submerged in sea in long rows which bind local soil ) the coral beaches and see corals in sea by glass bottom boats ,the viper and Ross island ,Journey through ATR to see original tribes (if you are lucky to spot ); visit Baratang through ATR to see as said above Andaman tribes ; Lime stone cave ; and the only existing mud Volcano in India ;but one has to start early around 4 am if one wants to visit these two places as passage through ATR is regulated and closes at 6 pm .There are many other tourist attraction . If you are a Honeymooner; newly married or elderly couple and wants only to relax go directly to Havelok island instead of staying at Port Blair and relax in one of many resorts .I stayed in Symphany Palm Beach Resort ,but another good resort is just opposite Radhanagar beach. Viper Island in within port Blair Huber where one see long row of commercial ships and yards and beautiful jolly Buoys Island There are lot to do for younger adventures persons like snorkeling ,and water sports . Do not forget to cruise in the sea on a good boat . Make sure before you plan trip take the help of a local tour operators. The tour cost differ from type of hotel one chooses There are plenty of tour operators but only few provide personalized service .

The spot that one may want to go to in Port Blair, apart from Cellular Jail of course, is Chidiyatapu. This place is truly nice. The beach is clean, the waves are gentle, the slope is gentle and the view of sunset is breathtaking.",Mar-12

doubles as a garbage tip,global_pilgrim,"Adelaide, Australia",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,07-Jan-12,"We had some time to kill in Port Blair before catching our flight home, so we decided to check out Corbyn's Cove. The amount of rubbish here was disturbing - everywhere you looked. There were some workmen cleaning up some rubbish, but they seemed more interested in the natural waste - leaves, branches and palm fronds - than the plastic littered all around. A lot of that plastic is small (lollie wrappers etc) and embedded in the sand, so it would take a mammoth effort to restore this place. 

There is also significant structural damage to the concrete and road that looks like it could have been caused by the tsunami several years ago. 

Apart form the (dirty) beach there is nothing else there - no coconut or other vendors. A resort lives behind the beach, but the gardens there (while clean of rubbish) look just as dilapidated. Save yourself the time and skip this beach. The worst beach on Havelock or Neill is far better. More",Jan-12

An Interesting Old Saw Mill,Igirl,"Lowestoft, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,29-Feb-16,"I first visited Chatham Saw Mill back in 1998. At that time you wandered in, signed a visitor's book, and someone took you around the various workshops and storage units. A tip was given at the end of the tour and both parties were happy. 

Many years on and it has been turned into a tourist attraction of sorts. The layout is more or less the same and you are able to see where the tree trunks are delivered, seasoned and stored. You can also witness the process of sawing and sizing of the wood. No consideration is given to safety for the workers and indeed the visitor. A cursory wave of the hand by the workers to indicate where you should stand or move to for your own safety is all you will get. 

There is a museum with some nice carvings and displays giving information about the various woods and the geography of the Andaman Islands in general. There is also a shop where various wooden items can be purchased.

Wonderful visit,margaritta3,Lincs,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,01-Mar-14,"My husband and I loved this place, which was part of our tour whilst in Port Blair. We love wood, so it made it a special place to see where it all happens. 

The museum is a great place to read up on the history and it houses many lovely photos of the time when the elephants were involved in the logging and transportation of the logs from Havelock Island. 

Although the directions of which way you should be going, are a bit hit and miss, it actually made it quite good fun, trying to work out where we went next. If you appreciate wood, you will love the different areas, where the wood has been categorised and graded. Nothing seems to be wasted, as even at the end of the process, the odd bits are sorted for the local craftsmen/market folk to take away. 

I was particularly impressed with the huge rollers that bring the logs from the water, into the saw mill, like a huge conveyer system. There was also a massive circular saw, the biggest I have ever seen. Be sure to stand next to it, to really appreciate it's size! 

A lovely way to spend an hour if you enjoy a bit of history More",Nov-13

Beautiful Beach,Soppa_0312,"Pune, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,05-May-19,"We visited the Kalapathar beach as an option to the Elephant Beach as the same was closed due to rainfall. Kalapathar beach was a surprise to us and we thoroughly enjoyed our visit there. Though it was raining but we still enjoyed being in water. Due to rainfall the patthar (stones) had submerged in water & we had to be cautious while in water to avoid any injuries. 

Our biggest surprise were the Dolphins which we could see while swimming on the beach. The dolphins had come near the shore due to torrential rainfall and the sight was soothing. The food served there is also good and the locals are very helpful. They volunteered to keep our bags in their shops without charging anything. More",May-19

Clear blue waters, soft sand and a great sunrise everyday. We trailed away from the main beach area and the crowd and then felt like we had our own private beach.

Romantic evening at a beach,PSMahapatra,"Kathmandu, Nepal",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,14-Mar-19,"My recommendation visit Kalapathar beach during the evening. Around 3-5pm. They close the beach around 5pm. Its a beautiful beach with a nice surrounding. A good place to sit with your partner talk, feel the winds, the sound of the waves and the sight of the ocean itself. Definitely you can feel the magic happening.",Feb-19
Wrong timings for me maybe,astonish77,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,13-Mar-19,My tour experience Andamans set a time of afternoon for this beach. Later I came to know that travelers visit here early in morning. You can enjoy swimming here and nice photos.,Mar-19

Visit for Sunrise. 5AM,Partha9,"Silchar, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,11-Mar-19,"If you can arrange for early morning transport to this place, Dont miss the sunrise. Layers of colours will mesmerize your eyes. Stay there for sometime, listen to the waves and birds. Come back to your hotel, by now you probably will be sleepy. Go back again with a fresher mood after 2 hours. This is a good place for swim. 

Now do remember this things. When you visit early morning you will probably be able to enjoy the sand. As that time would be low tide and the waves will be far enough. But during day time, you wont be able to see much sand. That makes it a little tough. Coz, there are rocks and sharp stone beneath. my advice, dont go too far. The rocks are actually little far from the edge. So stay near the edge. 

Best will be, if you want to avoid the touristy crowd. Walk a little further inside the forest. Or ask anyone for the way to the toilet. There you will find a beautiful place with bamboo benches and nice shade to relax and enjoy the shade. 

Happy Holidaying. More",Apr-18
Good for scenic photography,allanlakra17,"Ranchi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,05-Mar-19,"It is located in the southern part of the island, and was predominantly nearer to our hotel. It is beautiful to look at. But better not to dive in the water. Just as the name suggests, it is a rocky beach and has sharp rocks jutted out along the beach. But you can have beautiful pictures out there especially romantic ones. Though you ought to look out for occasional pieces of glass which few anti-social elements and haters of nature may have thrown on the beach.",Feb-19

Underrated beach,AbhishekJ1100,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,28-Feb-19,While radhanagar is the best beach in havelock.. kalapathar beach is not far behind.

BEAUTIFUL,globetrotter_raghav,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,25-Feb-19,This is one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever seen. Although the coast line is not much as it is near the road…. but the color of the water and the way it merges with the horizon and then the sky is just too good… It is a must visit if you are visiting Havelock. Even our 5-month-old infant loved it!! Lots of shops for souvenirs and coconut water. Surprisingly it wasn’t very crowded and turned out to be a very nice experience.,Feb-19
Blue and green lush,nagpalsunil80,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-Feb-19,"Beautiful blue and green lush water. 
Shades of blue and green water will attract you. 
This beach is not for bath since falling tree leaves and bunches make it dirty . 
It is just to have good pics, sit and enjoy. 
Since havelock is not so big so you don’t have much options to go. 

So you have to come here .",Feb-19

CONSIDERED BEST FOR SUNSET,Tarique S,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,23-Jan-19,"I was told that this beach is best for sunset, so we planned our visit accordingly. I found what I heard of. The golden sunset made the view spectacular. Nice, beautiful beach with lots of big black Rocks, perhaps that's why its called ""Kalapathar"" (meaning: Black Rock). We simply sat there at beach side, enjoyed the serenity and silence. Walked on sea shore while waves were kissing our feet. It was a romantic scene there. I really had a great time with my beautiful lady. 

Important Infos: 
1 This beach doesn't have restaurants, so you have to depend on small stalls which mainly sells chips and fizzy drinks etc. 

2. When comapred to Radhanagar and Elephant Beach, I would give it third place. But people who loves silence and less of crowd would rate it better. More",Feb-18
Beauty Stoned beach,Raja_Dut,"Guwahati, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-Jan-19,As the name suggests the beach is filled with black stones which have been formed by corals. It's a beautiful beach to visit. You can't get any activities here but just relax and sink in the beauty. Do taste the coconut milk available in the stalls.

Kalapathar Beach,cosmopolitan719353,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,15-Jan-19,This is a small beach which is good for watching sunrise. You need to go early in the morning around 4.45 am to watch the sun rise. Its a small beach next to road side with small shack shops around there which sell local handicrafts. Couple of shacks sell maggi which is worth tasting while its hot. The beach has lot of pointed stone which can hurt you while you walk barefoot. But you will see lot of small sea shell walking on the beach.,Feb-18
Clear blue water and lovely scenery,Indianpopcorn,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,15-Jan-19,"This was the first beach we visited on our trip to Havelock. We reach in the morning, around 9 and as soon as we reached the place, we fell in love. The beach itself is full of broken corals and shells so its a bit rough to walk but venture couple of meters into the sea (its shallow) and you will be greeted with super soft sand and gentle, lovely waves of transparent, clear water. On one side of the beach, it a large number of trees, adding to the beauty of the place and on the left side, a large tree trunk is lying in the most majestic fashion. No one can resist taking a pic on that one. Walk a little further and you will reach the end of the beach with large flat rocks and very very shallow sea water pool. 
Not very crowded and you can find your own little secluded private place, we all loved the beach. Easily the most beautiful beach at the Havelock island. More",Jan-19
sun rise beach,vineetdel,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,14-Jan-19,the beach is best known for its amazing view of the rising sun. of course you will have to get up early from the bed. the beach is clean and the water is mostly safe. there are some stalls offering the usual beach side trinkets and snacking options. but the main attraction is of course the gorgeous view of the ocean.,Dec-18
a decent beach,indrajit1405,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,10-Jan-19,its a decent beach but hardly any beach as such. There is not much place to hang around in the beach as the sand portion is very small. But the shops around and the green cover makes it a place worth a visit,Dec-18

With not much accomodation still around, place is not much crowded and also relatively clean. Amazing shells to spend your time looking around or simply just gaze away your time looking at the different sea shades. Worth a try to stopover enroute also for some pristine un-commercialised views. Kiosks at the main beach are not an irritant as selling is confined to kiosks only. So walk towards the non- rocky end, pack some food ( & please take all litter back with you) and find your peace stretch ...",Dec-18

Guess what, I have and in my last visit to this wonderland, I visited this less known wonder of the Havelock Island. 
You will not hear about this from many but the moment you close your ears and follow your mind to the southern part of the island, you will reach Kalapathar Beach. 
As the name suggest, its a rocky beach with (Kala) black (Pathar) rocks laying here and there. But that does not spoil the fun. It makes it an ideal place for birds to relax and is a paradise for photographers. The moment the waves hits the rocks and splashes into the beach makes your camera shutter go wild. The beach is clean and well maintained. You get a lot of vendors selling coconut water, hats and snacks. There is a designated parking and a place for children and senior citizens to rest. The only things that it lacks is a well maintained washroom. 
All in all, its a must visit for all and if you want to give pleasure to your eyes, sit by a corner and look at the different shades of water in the sea. More",Sep-17

Amazing view of sunrise,drparin,Rajkot,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,13-Jun-18,"We were told that Kalapathar beach is not something special and we could skip it. As we had stayed at a resort in Vijaynagar beach, sunrise was seen from Vijaynagar beach also. 

However, as we had enough time, we went to Kalapathar beach in one morning. The view of sunrise was amazing and pleased all of us. We felt that we would have missed something, had not we visited the beach. 

The road is also scenic and is more enjoyable if one is on bike/bicycle. 

There are attractive arrangements for sitting and snacks are available at the beach. 

Because of stones, the beach is not suitable for bathing.

Good but Over-rated for Sunrise,RitikaC63,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,21-Jan-18,I felt this place over-rated for Sunrise. Don't trust Google Maps for this place.Its incorrectly marked on Google. Its known so because of a black rock at a place on the beach. Something different here- you have few eateries near the beach. Shopping sea-shells is not a good idea. Its too expensive.,Dec-17
Beautiful beach,Samir_bedarkar,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-Jan-18,"When one talks of Havelock, Radhanagar and Elephant Beaches come first to the mind. But this beach, located East of the Jetty (approx 20 mins drive) is less frequented yet absolutely marvellous. In fact, at 0830 am we were among the first visitors there!! 
It has a beautiful white sand and some rocks on the northern end (that's why the name) and the waters are turquoise and blue. In fact, when seen during early morning (before 10 am), on can see different hues due to sunshine. 
Place has some shacks selling eatables etc and a changing room plus washrooms.

WOW,Rahulakkara,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,05-Jan-18,"If there is one beach at Havelock that’s caught my attention. It’s this one . Kala Pathar beach is a magnificent one with a beautiful sight of the green waters and the ocean.

We saw sunrise on a morning at kalapathar and enjoyed rare photo shots along the dried tree and rock decks .. come alone , come as a couple , come as a group - but do spend time alone at the beach - walking , star gazing as it helps give you time to think U !

The beach is full of snails , oysters. The snails are of various sizes and colours. There are few birds which come near beach to catch fish. 

There are few fallen trees which are remains of the tsunami and make for some good photography . 

Put a lot to suncream and go to the beach as you will be badly tanned. Also wear ur swim suit inside so you dnt need to change twice . Carry a Change of clothes. Dnt swim near the rocky side.

It’s a nice beach but nothing much to do here however the Bike Ride to Kaala Patthar Beach was scenic. 

You see a ton of dead corals on the beach, a dead tree and a supposedly black rock. You can wind up in max 1 hour and visit other places.. 

The best part of my visit was photographing hundreds of tiny, microscopic hermit crabs breaking out of their dead mother/feeding on a bigger dead hermit… one of the two am not sure… 
They were scampering to find empty shells, playing with each other or picking up any tiny scraps of shells & mounting it on top… 
Also managed to take a decent pic of cockles/clams feeding off/homed in a dead wet root of a tree 

My Camera had a microscopic mode so I managed to take few pics which I will always cherish

Hence it is called as kalapattar. I think that once it was a beach of coral reef for unknown reasons the coral have become dead and stones are out of water. There is no scenic beauty here. We can see the local fruit pandas here in plenty. Those fruits are being eaten by Jarava Tribes. Here you can see waste plastic bottles as symbol of negligence of tourists.

"Excellent Beach, Amazing Views!",rprasanna1982,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,18-Dec-16,"If you go to Havelock Island, you should have a must do for 3 things - Elephant Beach (for all water sports); Radha Nagar Beach (for the absolutely wonderful view and beach experience) and Kala Pathar Beach (purely for the view get whilst driving across the sloped path). 

Whilst once you have seen the RadhaNagar Beach, this won't hold a candle to it. Nevertheless, this is a great beach in its own right. The path to this beach gives real nice view as its carved across the road and is sloped. The beach ain't one when you can go and swim in the water probably but it's really great, calm and serene. 

Definitely worth every second of time that you would spend traveling to this beach. More",Dec-16
The Best Beach in Havelock,Manu_Pasha,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,18-Dec-16,"For me Kaala Pathar is the best beach in Havelock. Its a smaller beach compared to Radhanagar, but the color and quality of sand, various shades of green water and absolute safe sea floor for playing in the deep waters. This is one of the places where one can capture breathtaking portrait pictures because of the colors of nature around. 

Approach road is good, passing via Vijayanagar Beach and various famous hotels and resorts of Havelock.",Dec-16

Beautiful beach,An-itchy-feet,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,15-Dec-16,"This beach on Havelock island was not on our itinerary but I and my husband thought to make a visit to this place during afternoon as we had heard a lot about it. And as expected, this beach was superbly amazing, with so many black rocks around and hammocks to relax after a long walk. 

We were welcomed by a pleasant weather followed by drizzling for almost an hour. There are a few eateries around and you may not like to miss enjoying those tea, maggi and omelette. 

If you are staying in any resort at Vijay Nagar or Govind Nagar (Havelock Island), then you may hire an auto to take you to and fro to the beach. They will charge you 400 bucks and will wait for you for 1.5- 2 hours. Make sure to pay them once you take a return to your resort. 

Overall a good experience. More",Dec-16

Therefore I did not even think of visiting this beach though it was much more close to the place I was staying i.e. Coral reef resort. It was just that one evening I took my hired scooty and set off towards this beach as I had nothing else to do and soon realised ""what I would have missed - if I haven't ventured"" . the drive along the sea was amazing and lead to the small lovely beach with less people much as I would have loved.

You will find a couple of eating stalls (that serve maggi, samosa and egg rolls, and tea only). You can also shop for some souvenirs from small shops situated at the beach. 
During our visit there was high-tide because of which the space (to stroll on the beach) was very limited. And i could hardly see any ""KALA PATTHAR"". God knws why they named this place as kalapatthar beach. You can find more kalaptthar at Govindpur Beach (beach no.3) of havlock island :p",Dec-16

At low tide, you have many black rocks (which I personally didn't find attractive). It looks much better when the tide is coming in on a sunny day. The blues of the sea and the white sands and the lush green trees provide scenic memories. There are a few hammocks which you might find empty if you are lucky.

Heaven, Heaven, Heaven 

Im a beach lover and I absolutely fell in love with this beach as soon as I entered it. 
In my opinion its better that Radhanagar beach also. Water is true Aqua in color. 
White sand everywhere and fallen trees of the Tsumani and the black Stones make this an ultimate place. 
Plz don’t miss this place which is a few kms down frm Govindnagar beach. 
Plenty of shade next to the beach to sit and relax . Spend 2-3 hrs at least here. Take a stroll until you see the huge rocks and let the beauty sink in. Photographers paradise, I mean it . 
Have attached some pics, plz take a look named Gourav’s Visit.

Another Great Beach,Meghaj17,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,23-Nov-15,"Havelock Island is full of stunning beaches and vistas, so it should come as no surprise that this beach is nothing but beautiful! This a great beach to do some sun bathing or just lie and read a book under the shade of tree branches that lean towards the water. 

The beach closer to the water line is a little bit rocky (hence the name Kala Pathar) and one does have to be careful while entering and leaving the water. Also one does have to swim a little further out to actually be able to avoid the rocks. But seeing as the waters are calm that should not be problem at all. The beach itself is extremely clean and a lot less crowded than Radhanagar beach! 

Once again, make sure you rent a bike or take an auto to the Beach and make him wait while you have a lie about (We paid Rs 300 for the auto guy to take us from Dive India to Kala Pathar and back. He also waited there for about 2 hours) More",Nov-15

The name is a misnomer - this is not a rocky beach. We were pleasantly surprised - certainly a better experience than Radhanagar beach.

At about a 20 min drive from the airport, this is an easily accessible, relatively small beach, compared to the big-n-famous Radhanagar Beach. Kaala Pathar gets it's name from the black rocks of various sizes along the length of the beach. It's an ideal place to unwind and relax - we went for walks along the water, soaked in the beauty of the scenery from different vantage points like the large black rocks, a naked tree on the beach, and rested on the makeshift shacks and hammocks built along the shoreline. Many selfies & picture-postcards later, we rounded off the visit with sweet coconut water from the roadside stalls.

The long stretch of silver sands is rimmed with thick mangroves. Unlike the famed Radhanagar Beach, this beach is not crowded. It is clean and well guarded by male and female police. 

Here the sea is not very turbulent but for some reason bathing is not encouraged. I did not see any life saver also. I could not locate a normal water sprout or shower, but there is some enclosed area where one can change clothes. I would suggest that you stay close to the shore. Better still, sit on the wooden benches, sip tender coconut water and enjoy the awesome vista. More",Jan-15

Lovely Beach,Trinetra7,"Mysuru (Mysore), India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,22-Jun-15,"We went there in the noon. It was sunny, but not feeling so hot as there was cool breeze. 

Beach is almost like Radhanagar beach but with less sand. Water is very clean and clear with bluish colour. Shallow waters for considerable length in water. So one can safely enjoy in the water. Less people were there unlike Radhanagar beach. Hence, less disturbance. There are a few rocks in the water where one can go and sit, and enjoy the scenic beauty. There are a few thatched sheds for sitting and relaxing. A few shops with eatables are there near the beach. 

Good to stay near Radhanagar beach and visit Kaala Pathhar beach as Radhanagar beach is comparatively more beautiful and enjoyable. But Kaala Pathar beach is really a worth visiting beach in an evening. More",Feb-15
Beautiful Serene Beach!,premartha,"London, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,22-Jun-15,"This beach is one of the MUST-SEE places in Havelock Island. The huge black stones in the white sanded beach with clean and calm turquoise colored water gives this beach its name, a perfect spot for solitude and serenity as not so many people come here. You cannot swim or find any water sports here because of its rocky nature. You will find few eco huts with shade and bamboo benches to sit or a good idea could be to carry a hammock, tie it around a tree on the beach, lay down in the hammock and enjoy the view or spend time with yourself. There are few vendors outside selling coconut water, bhel-puri etc. On one side of the road is the beach and other side is lush-green forest. I would suggest hire a bike so that you can be independent and stop wherever you want, its around 8Kms from Dolphin resort and on the way also you can stop at many places to spend some time with your family or just be in solitude. If you travel further from the beach, Kala Pathar village is also a nice place to see in particular if you are on a bike. Go around sun-rise or sun-set for best experience. More",Feb-15

Secluded jewel of Havelock Island,BongTravelNerd,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-Jun-15,"Though this beach is not very popular or crowdy, this is an excellent beach. More like a Thai beach than an Indian beach. Water is azure blue and there is no wave. Almost still. It is in fact a lagoon with barrier reef. So there is not much movement in the water. No amenities in the beach. Water colour is excellent but the absolute silence all around is a bit intimidating. Very quiet beach. Only a foreigner couple from Denmark were there apart from us. When you hire a car for Radhanagar beach, ask the driver to take to Kaala Pathar beach for 1.5-2 hours.( Since not many people know about this beach) 
Water depth increase quickly if you go little bit inside and there is no wave action to send you back to shore. So get an air-filled tube ( Took 100 Rs. to hire each of them) for safety (just in case) and enjoy the eye-soothening secluded beauty. More",Oct-14

Drop dead gorgeous beach,JaideepVivekanand,India,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,29-Apr-15,"We visited the beautiful Kaalapathar Beach on Havelock Island for 2 days in April 2015. This is a small beach (not very wide or long) but very pretty. The sand is powdery white and there is a nice tree cover to lie under close to the water. The beach is somewhat rocky, but this cannot be seen at high tide. The beach is very shallow for at least 200 meters and waves were light even at high tide, which makes it ideal for children. There are thatched shelters along the beach with a changing room. A few small shops sell t-shirts, snacks and coconut. For a bigger meal, one can go to the Flying Elephant resort which is about 100m away. Must visit if you go to Havelock. More",Apr-15

Just for just,SubirBose,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,16-Apr-15,"It was some six kilometres from our resort namely Blue Bird. The auto here claims Rs.400/- (to and from with waiting charge) and the claim appeared to be irrational for such short distance to us. We thus opted for being a bit adventurous and went to the opposite side to reach the market. From the market one can go for the local cars which claims Rs.20/- per head (for the locals Rs.10/- they claim). Frankly speaking, the main spot of Kalapathar beach is not that eye-catching. Like other “also ran” beaches it is there just for just. The only property, the beach can boast of is its crystal clear blue water. 

While returning we suddenly noticed that there was no local car plying since it was the lunch time (between 12-00 to 1-00 noon) of the drivers. We became more adventurous and started walking towards the hotel. And here, yes here, we noticed the real beauty of Kalapathar beach and the nature surrounded by. It’s really was a great experience to have the great sea at your right and at your left the forest proving shade with big trees walking with you. This continued for 20 to 25 minutes and then a local car suddenly appeared to help us reaching our resort. More",Apr-15

I would rate as the best spot for sunrise in Havelock, and morning walk to the beach has been very adventurous. With a torch in hand, I headed alone but was able to reap the benefit of getting up early, and enjoy the astounding sunrise. Initially the cloud played a spoilsport but within no time the sun started staring, the clouds vanishedThe coconut trees on the shore gives a fabulous view of this island. 

Stretching towards the south of the beach, one would find lot of mangrove tress. The walk along the stretch was a lifetime experience. There are hardly any disturbance as very few visitors flock this beach at such a early morning.

Wonderful but underrated,358arvindn,"Pokhara, Nepal",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,17-Mar-15,"This is the first beach we visited and the one where we stayed the longest. 
Since not many people come here, its a quiet blissful experience all in all. When we reached the place, the tides had receded and corals were visible. We walked some length in towards the receded tides only to run back a sort while later.Its long and as good as any other beach in Havelock. 

However coming to the beauty of the place, its wonderful mix of blue and good amount of wind blowing. 
I seriously have no idea, why this beach is not worked upon by the Government to make it better and give it, its due credit. 
In fact, when we went into the beach, we were still not sure if this was the Kala Patthar beach or was it a bit far. Still we stayed for a good 2 hours and while we were returning we saw a small board proclaiming its name. 
Dont expect any parking, not much of a food or even tourist. Still go for it if you've got the time. If not, then better try #7 and Elephant Beach. But as I told, this beach has a charm of its own. 
Also I'm still curious why its named Kala-pathar. 

Plan as per the timing of high tide- perhaps it will be better to watch. More",Feb-15
Rough beach but still amazing,Anu_Bhav_Ban_sal,"Ahmedabad, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,17-Mar-15,i found the beach little rough as the waves were very high and was almost reaching the start of the beach. I found it same on both the days we visited thus cant say whether it was due to high tide or not. But should go to this beach for fun and enjoying the beauty of rough water.

They go inside their shells the moment one goes near them. Drink coconut water from any of the vendors outside. They taste the best.

Waves came crashing aginst the wall, it was high-tide, dividing the beach and the narrow winding road. I stopped my scooty at regular intervals just taking in the view. It was amazing.

Watched one of the best sun rise of my life,SandeepJana,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,11-Feb-15,"Had one of the most memorable trip of my honeymoon at this place. 

Our hotel was located on the west side of island near Radhanagar beach and we wanted to catch sun rise at Havelock , so was recommended to come to Kaala Pathar. And since its on the eastern side of the world, the sun rise generally happens around 4:45:5:00 AM. 
As our hotel was quite far so we started on two wheeler we hired at 3:30AM in the morning when it was pitch dark and reached this place. 

There was no soul around except for few annoying dogs and there was no light what so ever. But once it started to get bright, we could explore the beach freely. 

To be honest I liked this beach more than Radhanagar. The place was quite serene with clean beach and the sun rise was one of the best I have ever seen. 

We spend a lot of time here and were sad that we could not come here again owing to the distance from hotel and our tight schedule. 

Although it has a lot of rocks at places (thus the name) but still I think one can have a cool and refreshing dip too. 

A definite beach to visit at Havelock even if one does not want to catch the sun rise so early. More",Feb-15

The Sapphire,Sarwarborah,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,14-Jul-14,"The name Kaala Pathar doesn't not resonate with the beauty of the beach. It is pristine. Metaphorically speaking, like the Indian concept of putting a black dot on a spotless face to avoid evil attention, the villagers must have given it a not so attractive name thinking it will remain beautiful forever. But unfortunately, their belief has not paid rich dividends of late, thanks to increasing tourists, who litter the beach with garbage. Still it isn’t alarming, but it would be better if the authorities pull their socks fast. Food shacks are not a part of Andaman beaches, which means there is no life after nightfall. The waves are reasonably mild, and like the thumb rule for every beach, best time to visit is early morning or sunset. Good for romantic walks with your partner. Only request to anybody, who intends to visit Kaala Pathar in the future, please keep it clean. More",Jan-14

Average beach considering you're in Havelock,goodnight2die,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,29-May-14,"Not as clean and pristine as the other beaches in Havelock but if you are already on Beach No 5, then this is a quick ride away. Especially convenient if you are diving with one of the dive shops on the road, could drive down here in the evening since it will be the only one open by the time you get here. 

Not much is available in terms of food so don't go there hungry. A little walk further down the road will lead you to the Flying Elephant which has a cafe in case you have sudden hunger pangs. 

The water from the sea does not recede as far back as does at Beach No 5 so if you feel like a swim during low tide, this is where you should go. More",Mar-14

There is offcourse kala pathar (Black stone) and dont agree with the Chhaya's family above review. He may have visited the beach at a time of high tide. When I returned from the beach it was completely flooded with water, even no space fora walk down the beach around 3.30 pm (Mid of March). 
The travel agent don't like it too much as there is no shops or soaps, though there is a few hundred meters away from it.

The best beach for us in Havelock,Voyager_Nineteen71,"Pune, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,25-Apr-14,"This beach is a little far away from the jetty, but was again very close to our resort. Given that it is known for sunrise, my wife and children hired a couple of bikes and rode down to this beach. 

It is simply beautiful in that there are no waves. The beach is shallow for quite a distance so those who do not know swimming at all too can enjoy the water. Kids can really enjoy a lot as there are no waves that can frighten children.The water is very clean...bluish green. One can float in the water with back down for quite some time... 

There are a couple of shacks where one can sit under the shade, but otherwise there are no facilities on the beach in terms of eateries or changing rooms. It is not visited by too many people and hence virtually a private area. 

One caveat As you enter the beach, it is preferable to go onto the left side of the entrance where there are no small rocks too. 

Also, it can get very hot after 10 AM for people not entering the water. 

Do not be afraid of keeping belongings outside. It is safe. More",Mar-14

The beach has nice shaded sitting areas and a guy selling coconut water at the entry.

Picturesque beach!,Pramod G,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,12-Feb-14,"Kala Pathar is perhaps next only to Radhanagar in beauty. The place is characterised by peace and quititude. The public transport is almost nonexistent in Havelock. Perhaps it is a folly to expect it in such a remote place. However, many Cabs and Auto rickshaws are available to reach this place. 

We reached Kalapathar in the afternoon and found none except an amorous young European couple and a couple of very entertaining vendors. 

There was plenty of drift wood and a few opportunities for photo shoot. The sea water is clear but nothing could be compared to Radhanagar. If the choice is between Radhanagar and Kala Pathar, I would prefer an extended stay at the latter. 

My fond memories of this place could be attributed to an old man who had migrated from east Pakistan and has settled there. He serves tea on the beach and has a wonderful voice. He entertained us through his very mellifluous voice for a long time. 

In all, Kala Pathar is a secluded beach which provides a beautiful view of sunrise. More",

AWSOMEEEE WAVESS,Stef S,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,04-Feb-14,"Whatever people may say, this beach was my favorite. We enjoyed ourselves over here even more than Radha nagar beach. We were on our to Kala Phattar on our rented Activa. One thing about the Andaman’s is that you always have the beach on one side of the road while riding. Keeping that in mind we didn’t know that we reached Kala Phattar until we accidently asked some one. We had just stopped by to look at a certain portion of the beach looked so lively and beautiful. The beach definitely brought out the kids in us. The waves were double your size and strong. They just hit you one after the other. This is definitely a place for water and sea lovers. The only thing to be careful is about finding a nice spot in the water that don’t have rocks on the sea bed. This sea may get pretty rough in the evenings so you better have someone who can swim along with you. The waves are so cool that you don’t feel like leaving the beach at all. We spent around 90 minutes here and we returned to this place the next morning. It called Kalla Phattar (black Stone)cause the huge black blocks of stones that are in the sea. This beach is not that far from the main Havelock market. Just a 10 min bike ride from there. More",Jan-14

A treat for your eyes..but I wouldn't take a dip in the sea here,aparnaka11,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,04-Aug-13,"I rented out a bicycle and rode down to this beach early one morning. The ride is as picturesque as the destination. The road on both sides is adorned by green tropical forest. You keep catching regular glimpses of the sea on the one side as cycle along the way. The roads are winding and a joy to ride. The last stretch is so scenic that I do not find words to describe. The road is at an elevation and you can see the endless blue green sea stretched out as long as your eyes can see. A huge black rock jutting out at the beach and some uprooted trees add a nice touch. 

But the beach itself is very dirty with wafer covers, soda cans and the like. Also all that the sea has washed up shore is also left unattended to. There is no changing room, toilets and other such tourist touches here.

Good things first: 
Amazing water - It is blue in colour and when u take a dive u feel fresh instead of sticky feel of the sea. 
Not crowded - It is still away from the general crowd (this is becoming an issue in Goa) 
Hired two wheeler - u get two wheeler on hire for 350 to 450 bucks.. 
Food - Variety available (Imagine u get hummus here!) 

Cons: 
Bit far.. Not a weekend destination at all 

Havelock is a must desination if u want to enjoy rexaling besides blue water. 
Just tho hrs from Port Blair (by sea) and u r here. 

Attractions - Not much except Radha Nagar beach, elephant beach but the best is kalapatthar ..

Emerald waters,arunasokkumar,"Bangalore, Karnataka, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Sep-12,"If you were wondering where on earth can we see the green seas that we usually see in movies.

A very quiet secluded beach…..,Atish M,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,23-Aug-12,"We stayed at Silver Sand which was the last resort on the road. From our resort this beach was just 3 KM away. We had hired cycles during our stay to the island and hence every afternoon after out lunch we used go to this beach laze around. 

This is a very small beach but very beautiful. It has white sand and the water looks green. It is probably the best place on the island for people who wish to swim. There were hardly any people that we could find on this beach. The cycle ride to the beach was fun once the resorts end the road becomes narrow and one side you will see the sea and the other side you have the lush green jungle. People who would like to laze around would surely love the beach. This is completely non-commercial beach. 

There are no shops around this place hence do carry water and something to eat if you want to. More",Sep-11
Kala patcher beach is a lovely beach,UdhayarajaDrJ,Chennai,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,29-Jul-12,"The water is so clear and transparent, greenish some places and light blue some other places. A lovely place to spend time",Dec-11
dense forest and sea,nidberera,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,28-Jul-12,the combination of dense nature on one side with the sea on the other makes us totally one with nature. a bike ride to this place just to enjoy the cool breeze on your face or even walking barefoot on this beach until the famous rock and have angry waves spash water at you is just out of the world!,Jul-12
"Great Beach, Desolate, private",sudipnandy,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,20-Jul-12,"We went there at 10am. My family was the only humans on the beach.

small but very tiny and romantic beach,MartinPestik,"Fort Lauderdale, Florida",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,12-Jul-12,my feelings about this beach are influenced by the timing of travelling - low season caused not many people came to the island therefore this beach was totally empty...nice blue see whit white sand and natural umbrellas - wonderful..,Jun-12
Off beat beach,adnand1,"Hyderabad, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,03-Jul-12,"Though a rocky beach beach (Black rocks which is why it is known as Kaala Pathar beach) it has its own charm and beauty. Located on the other side of the Havelock Island, it is worth paying a visit. The beach is more or less deserted compared to the famous Radhanagar beach, so if you are looking for a lone, peaceful, relaxing atmosphere; your at right place. A must visit!",Nov-11
good one,MShaks,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,28-Jun-12,Though a lil far ....cleanliness is also not as good as Radhanagar beach but still good one.,Feb-12
BEWARE OF STONES AND ROCKS,RAJESH S,"Kochi (Cochin), India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,25-Jun-12,"Good beach to view and if a suitable place is found can swim and enjoy. Stay away from the rocks and stones hideen under water which kids may not notice. Adult supervision mandatory. Well kept beach though with close quarter views of crab colonies, shell creatures. Good place to spend half a day peacefully.",May-12
QUIET & CALM,travelrims,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,19-May-12,this beach is a bit far away from the main place.perhaps this is one of the reasons why this beach is so isolated.we went to this place in hired bicycles (rs70/day).on the way the scenic beauty was amazing.on one side there was sea and other side dense forest.you will get to meet very few people here.view was good but the beach was unclean.in some places the colour of the water was black because of presence of black rocks underneath. do carry water & snacks because there are no shops,May-12
Go for the ride not the beach,Vamsi N,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,02-May-12,"After you have been to Radha Nagar beach, no other beach would appeal so much. But one should go to Kala Pathar Beach for the pleasure of riding through the woods. Hire a bike and ride all the way to kala Pathar beach all along the sea. I bet you would want to do it again and again.",Apr-12
Kaala Pathar Beach,rishi700,"Haldia, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,25-Apr-12,"The Kalapathar beach is situated on one corner of Havelock Island. The beach gets its name from the surrounding village, which is Kalapathar Village and the black rocks (known as Kalapathar in Hindi) that adorn the coastline here.There will be very little crowd of tourists.If you want to take bath at this beach then you can but ladies beware as there are no changing rooms you have to return to your resorts and change.You can rent a two wheeler and have a visit at kaalapathar beach.Its not too far from havelock.As there are less crowds you can take your own time there and enjoy it.It is a very clean beach.If you want to stay there for long hours take some snacks with you and of course drinking water as there are no shops nearby to this beach.

"Very beautiful, not so clean",csrikanth1,"Boston, Massachusetts",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,29-Mar-12,"The Kaala Pathar beach is very comparable to the Radhanagar beach except that it is not very well maintained. The water is very murky and dirty right at the beach, something not very welcome for people like me who do not go beyond 10 feed :). Otherwise a beautiful beach, you should take a bike and ride along the beach making pit stops on the way. Some of the naturally bent trees look very beautiful.",Mar-12
Untouched beautiful beach…Best way to spend a morning on beach.,priteshkulkarni,"Pune, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,03-Mar-12,"We visited this beach in morning and its really amazing untouched beach. Nothing special as such but very lonely and feel like our private beach. When we were on this beach there were hardly 3 couples. Good place for couple photo section. Tripod is needed as you won’t get any one to take your snaps or you have to wait.Very safe place but not a good for swimming. 

We loved this beach so couples can think of this to spend good time with each other.",Feb-12
Nice place,rups33,Delhi,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,21-Feb-12,"Go there in the morning when you will get very little crowd. There are stretches which are rocky, but you will be able to find safer places. You will feel as if you are enjoying the sea at your private beach.",Jan-12
Dead Coral Treat,HitenT,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,09-Feb-12,"This is a beautuiful place not sure if many people go there, i rate this higher than Radha nagar because it is calm and quite and one thing what Radha Nagar doesnt have and it has lote of Dead corals on the beach good time is early morning, amazing colored corals and the water color is simply breathtaking.",Jan-12
"a quiet, beautiful beach",adityaksingh,"Indore, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,09-Feb-12,"kaala pathar beach is situated around 6 kms from the main market area. it is a quiet and clean beach with crystal clear blue waters which i believe is a trademark for the sea around the andamans. this beach is less crowded as compared to the radhanagar beach but is a close equal to it in its beauty. sometimes i found the sea to be more lovely here than at the radhanagar but it may just be a perceptual difference after all. Just lay out a beach mat under the blue skies and relax ; read a book or just dose off. Simply said "" a place to relax""",Feb-12
Quite but mesmerizing,NeerajS,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,07-Feb-12,"Visited kal pathar beach twice during my stay at havelock. The place is in clear contrast to radhanagar beach. The sand portion is bit limited but u can take a long walk down the stretch. The place is named after kala pathar village nearby. There is one bit of black rocks which might have prompted the name. 

Water is pristine, clear and mesmerizing on this beach. Great place to click photographs. Had one of the best experiences of photography at the place. 

Very few people come to place even in peak times. So a gud place to take stroll in the morning. Not recommended for swimming or sunbathing.",Jan-12
Avoid! Nothing compared to Beach No.7 and Beach No.5,vinod_hyd,"Hyderabad, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,24-Jan-12,"A very small stretch of sand with a lot of rocks near Kalapathar village. This beach is a total waste of time. Go to Beach No.7 instead. Beach No.5 is a lot better than Kalapathar beach. If you take a tour package, tour operators will slip this one in as a point of visit to just fill up your itinerary. That's the only reason you would visit this beach.",Jan-12

Pretty good but not as great as RadhaNagar Beach,DevSaha,"Hyderabad, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,25-Dec-11,This is a nice secluded beach in Havelock where you can drive down in 20 mins.

Not adivsed,Debashish1511,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,19-Dec-11,"Dont go , its a waste of time. Our travel agent dropped us there, and left for 1hour.

Horrible. Nothing to enjoy,Suhas56,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,14-Nov-11,We went there and found nothing to enjoy. If one has not seen Radhanagr or some of the beaches from Port Blair before coming here then it might be a average quality beach. The beach does not look good to swim and nothing much to do if one is not planning to go in the water.,Nov-11
Another Awesome Experience !,RatishKN,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,04-Nov-11,"Beautiful Place. The sands - again white...though was a bit rocky at places. The beach was not as wide as RadhaNagar Bear. However, the water... clear, blue and beautiful - more than made up for the thin strip of the beach. 
One can just sit and watch the water for hours. 
The waves were really gentle and it was a great just sitting and watching the calm waves and blue water. 
Really an awesome beach !",Oct-11

Gateway to where horizons meet,TapasyaKaulRajaram,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,25-Mar-19,The treck to the tip of Chidiya Tapu was worth the effort. It is a 3 km trek from the beach up till the highest point. One has to cross a tropical jungle and walk. The walk was pleasant as there were so many trees which paved the way and it was shady and cool along the way thanks to those trees. It is totally totally worth it.,Mar-19

BEST SUN SET IN PORT BLAIR,Saanjhraman,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,05-Mar-19,"This is a serene place and best place to watch sunset if you are in Port Blair. I didnt write Andaman as best place in Andaman is Radha Nagar beach (one of the top beaches in Asia itself). But, if one is in Port Blair, one must travel 27 km to watch this place where sea turns golden during sunset. The beach is clean and water is also superb. Tracking is the other option if you reach well before 3 pm. There are no birds ofcourse as name suggests, but, the place is a must visit.",Jan-19

Good time spend in evening,contact_mohit33,Gurgaon,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,26-Feb-19,Spent a good time on chidiya tapu beach followed by sun set views. Though name gives a view of some garden but nothing is related to that. You can enjoy see waves along with some beautiful views from top as well as from beach. Pretty far from Port blair city but worth a visit.Opening time is till 5PM or till Sunset whichever is late.,Jan-19
"You can see a real steep cliff, caves & coves described by Enid Blyton in many of her adventure books.",KSNAR,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,22-Feb-19,"Chidiya Tapu is a misleading name for this place. It is 27 Kms from Port Blair. 

For starters, there is a small biological garden where you won't find a single bird, aka, chidiya !!! 

Having said that, it is a place from where trekking trail of around 1.50 Kms begin (Munda Pahar), natural path created by flowing water during rains, winding up the hills through reasonable dense forest and sea down there far below. The trail ends on top of a cliff where the sea forms a V shape around the cliff. 
The cliff rises from the sea and is perpendicular to it, with a steep drop. Caves can be seen at the point where the cliff rises from sea. 

You could even see a spectacular sunset from this point, but unfortunately you are not allowed to remain there after 5 pm, without getting the forest guards come and search for you. 

There is a separate sunset point nearby and a good view can be had from there. 

All in all, a good place for trekkers and nature lovers. 

Worth visiting.

Chidiya tapu - trek to nature,GautamM251,"Noida, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,13-Feb-19,This is a place just 90 mins away from Port Blair. There is a place where Crocs breeding happens n are available . Then there is a trek right up to the hilltop . Last time to enter the forest is around 3pm.the trek has natural steps which is formed by the tree roots. Forest is quite sense and rarely you get sunlight on your way to the top. But once you reach the top the view is absolutely stunning. We were lucky to see a double there. It's quite relaxing . It's about 1.5-2 KMS trek but worth it. On your way back you can enjoy the sunset . Must visit if you are at Port Blair. More,Sep-18

less travelled beautiful place in Andaman - Chidiya Tapu beach,AmitMantri,"Mira Bhayandar, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Jan-19,"I and my husband both love to explore new places, so we used to get up early and visit serene beaches for sunrise. Our driver suggested this beach to us in port blair. On the way we saw the sunrise. Then he took us for a trek of about 45 minutes. There was not a single person other than us. The view from the top was mesmerising and worth seeing. If you are a nature lover then must go for this trek. Beach was also different from other beaches, and better than hyped colvyn's cove beach and wandoor beach. Btw Havelock and Neil Island beaches are the most beautiful beaches in andamans. More",Feb-18

The beach has been closed as there were couple of incidents of crocodile sighting. You cant go into the water, the life guard will not allow you to. But the place is quite serene and lovely. It's a quite beach, with hardly any waves but the water is as clear as anywhere else in this paradise. The most unique thing is that it is surrounded by small islands and that gives it a very unique look. The sunset here is quite popular. We liked the place overall but frankly there are better things in Andamans.",Jan-19

Scuba diving Experience!!,Vincy275,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,14-Dec-18,"This place doesnt offer any commercial activity in abundance as such. Just a secluded place away from the hustle bustle of the city. 1 hour drive from city. famous for good sunset point, though we personally didnt find it amazing. We went there for scuba diving experience, organized by infinity scuba. That was a surreal experience and the sight was amazing. It is said that not many people choose this site for scuba and hence the place is still untapped / clean and offers great view. 

For the place Cidiya Tapu is a hype and better places a available to explore.",Dec-18

Sunset Bliss,mohitchakravorty,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,05-Dec-18,"We took a scooty ride on hire in 400 INR and drove from the city of port Blair to Chidiya Tapu. 
There are many ways to reach here but ideal is to have offline maps downloaded before you land this bful part of earth as network won't be there most of the places to bother u(including phone internet) 

I reached in just under 2 hours to chidiya tapu. The way is mostly good barring a few rough patches. The place from where u enter Park before there I found a swarm of people. Being a Fone fotographer I had to find my spot so drove back about 3 kms where I saw a beach en-route. 

This proved to be the right decision and the view was breathtaking. More",Nov-18
Too much travel for Nothing,DebasishNath,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,02-Dec-18,"Its a made up view point to add iternary on a travel map. Nothing spectacular about the sunset here. Those of us who stayed near Aberdeen bazaar, don't visit this place, not worth the time , money and pain taken to get here. Just an ordinary beach. The trouble to get there is humongous. The last mile road to this place is in utterly pathetic condition. We are vibrating all they way to thus place due to the infinite potholes on this road. If you have an evening in port blair and nothing else to do, they stay at ur hotel but don't waste your money getting to this place. More",Nov-18

"Went for a sunset view, disappointed",gogoipj,"Tinsukia, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,27-Nov-18,"This place along with Munda Pahar beach are said to be good place to witness a beautiful sunset. We (with my wife) rent a scooty from Aberdeen bazar and went there at afternoon time. The sun sets at the hill top too early hence it doesnot produce the glow that we were expecting during sunset. Got disappointed. Much better sunset can be seen at riverbank of Brahmaputra. Beach is small and crocodile fearfactor is always there. Cidiya Tapu is a pure hype, overated, instead go for Wandoor beach which is also 30 km away from Aberdeen bazar like Cidiya Tapu.",Nov-18

I saw few varieties of deer, boars, crocodiles, monkeys, monitor lizards and many types of plant and bird species.

The park is too small, but a great location if one can hire an international zoo designer and build it! 

Entry fee and electric vehicle is very much affordable @ Rs.20/- each per head! 

The beach is with flooded with warning of salt water crocs! A pristine beach with no entry to water! Sunset is amazing and thats when it gets really crowded.

Awesome sunset,Shalini S,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,03-May-18,"Chidiya tapu is the sunset point of Port Blair. The view of the sun setting over the sea is just awesome as the entire Ocean slowly turns red.....One can sit and lose oneself in the beauty of nature. 

Takes about an hour to reach from Port Blair by vehicle. The road condition is not good as it meanders through the tropical forest. 

There is a biodiversity park just before chidiya tapu which one can visit with children. Thereafter one can proceed. 

Chidiya tapu has a scenic beach with seating area. There are trees uprooted in the tsunami which make a great photo point. Swimming is allowed only inside the enclosed area as there are salt water crocodiles in the area. NOT advisable to take chances.... 

One can trek from the beach to Munda pahar. The view from the top is amazing. 

Worth a half day visit if one has the time. 
Advisable to carry some foodstuff as there are very few vendors selling some basic stuff like coconut water. Beach closes at 5 pm. More",Apr-18

A beautiful mangrove beach where you could maybe see a crocodile or two and probably sea-snakes too.,Jai06,"Ambala, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,19-Apr-18,"Chidiyatapu is about 17 Km from Port Blair. The entry fee is Rs 20/- . There are staff (I think from the Forest Department) who politely brief you at the entry point about safety precautions as well as about environmental issues like the use of polythene etc. 

The entry fee is only Rs 20/- (for Indians). 

People who expect a beach to be full of ice cream vendors, balloon sellers, food stalls etc may find it disappointing because there is very little of all this here. 

However those who go expecting a clean and natural mangrove beach would be delighted. Bathing is permitted only within the netted areas due to the danger of crocodile attacks. 

One could go for short treks into the surrounding hillocks and could see small fresh-water rivulets joining the sea. It is said that sea-snakes come here to take a drink at these rivulets (they never ingest salt-water). At any rate we did spot a sea -snake in one of the rivulets. Did not see any crocodiles (disappointingly).

Basically if you are going on a packaged trip they will keep usually cellular jail on day 1 and Chidiyatapu on last day. Still if you have good amount of time then you can club both places on same day. (Get to the cellular jail sound and light show at 8.00pm). 
Sunset happens pretty early by 5.00pm so plan accordingly, better get in there pretty early and take some good pics.",Dec-17

A good place for watching sunset in port Blair,ShakirSharfrazA,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,19-Dec-17,"We had an evening free in Port Blair on returning from Port Blair. Our guide suggested this place and we went there. It was about a 40 minute drive to the beach. The beach was very marshy and muddy and not like the crystal clear beaches in Havelock. There is a trekking trail from the beach through the mountains to a vantage point to watch sunset. We opted out as we were tired. The view from the beach was good enough for me! 
There are huge native padauk trees all over here. There are warning signs about crocodiles to discourage tourists to get in to water. But I still saw people fooling around in water. Its a shallow beach. It was surreal to sea two dogs run deep in to water and still be able to see their legs! More",Jan-17

Its a quiet little place on the southern tip of south Andaman. It is tropical lush green with mangroves ,the blue sea and outstanding sunset views make it a unique place to visit.

A place to relax and reflect!,lenac1170,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,16-Nov-17,"Chidiyatapu is about 20 kms from Port Blair and is easily accessible by road. The highlights are mundapahad beach, the forest trek, and the biological park. The Mundapahad beach is quite small, but is quite spectacular because of the tall trees and the driftwoods. One can simply relax amidst the trees in the carved benches and listen to the chirping of the birds and the rhythm of the waves. On a clear day, sunset is especially stunning with an interplay of shades of gold against the backdrop of distant mountains. One can also take a dip in the sea which is quite shallow, although salt water crocodile sightings have been reported rarely. There is an area cordoned by nets for swimming, but the effectiveness of it is questionable. The trek to mundaparvat is about 1.5km, amidst the jungle to the end of land. The path is safe and offers great sights but is without guideposts. One can occasionally spot a lizard or a green snake, but can always hear the birds and insects. Keep a watch for the abundant butterflies which comes in all shapes and colors. The lighthouse, the partially depilated hut, the snaky sea, the height of land and the mountains afar offer plenty of opportunity for photography.

The forest guest house is the only accomodation in the vicinity, and is often fully booked. The beach has eco-friendly changing rooms, shower and washrooms which is decently maintained.

We didnt get the sunset view as the sky was very cloudy but I believe it's amazing . Also you can do scuba diving here at the lacadives scuba center . Dnt miss it suggest you come early morning book ur dive and then do the trek and visit to chidiya Tapu. 

Dnt miss the stick kulfi wala at the entrance of the beach. The kulfi is amazing and is made of local milk from andamans. It was too yummy. The only other place you get this kulfi is Ross Island. 

There is a biological park close to chidiya Tapu it has some animals and birds only specific to andamans. The amazing part of the park looks like a small forest with very old trees. It's has few animals but you have to walk quiet a bit. They have battery operated cars for those who can't walk.

Serene. Overcrowded. Oxymoronic?,WANDERLUST_KOL,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,23-Apr-17,"We headed for Chidiya Tapu, with our elderly parents, from Sinclairs Hotel around 3 .15 pm. It took almost an hour to reach. The scenery's beautiful as you would initially, for quite a time, hug the boisterous blue sea along with some great view points. And then the winding hilly road with some sharp turns and bumps. Take precautions for those who are motion sick. Avoid full stomach. 
On arriving it was a surprise cacophony of sort, with a number of vehicles and a rather large number of noisy visitors. Much like a picnic spot. Walking a few paces, getting the entry tickets, we entered a heavily wooded area with large tall trees, beautiful sit outs carved of large logs. 
And lo!! In front lay the mesmerising sea dazzling in all its hues in the setting sun. We were really ecstatic forgetting about the pain in getting there, the crowd. Remnants of the tsunami with some uprooted trees, create some abstract architectural beauty especially for those photographers searching for a novel foreground. 
Just sitting out the ever changing ambience, the setting sun creates and if possible sometime thereafter for some beautiful twilight shots (though the guards keep on pestering to leave the moment sun sets in). Quite irritating for ones who want to savour the moment for some more time. More",Dec-16

But if combined with Trek to Muda pahar View point then you can enjoy with option to swim, Trek and awesome view. If going to Havelock/Neil then chidiya tapu can be skipped but Mundapahar trek is do-able and gives a variety to otherwise beach-oriented trip. So in both cases do it with Mundapahar Trek. Else drop it. Time you may spent at Chidiya Tapu :30 minutes. Mundapahar : 2-3 hrs. You can ask your tour operator.

This attracts a lot of visitors and the place is chockful of people and vehicles. Fortunately the beach area is cordoned and out of bounds for vehicles . Visitors need to enter personal details such as name and phone no. in a register before entry and the place is swarming with very officious looking security personnel and also a few policemen. The beach is decent-sized and the shore line is fringed with a lot of tall trees . Like every other beach in Andamans this beach too boasts of crystal clean waters, picturesque looks and brilliant emerald green waters . 

As the name suggests, chidiyatapu ( corrupted version of chidiya top ?? ) is reputed to be a place where birds congregate . We did have high expectations of bird sightings but drew a blank save for a beautiful racquet-tailed drongo high up in the tree and a few cuckoos. The beach is of average sized, clean and free of debris . The security personnel were overzealous in getting bathers and visitors to the evacuate the beach before 5 pm thus not allowing a sunset view .

Also it is not advisable to take baths as the beach is crocodile's den and rocky. Best thing to enjoy is the sunset. One can plan a fishing trip to the Rutland island nearby (mostly done by foreigners). Cars are allowed till the parking lot in front of Munda Pahar beach and then you need to walk down to the waters on foot. Lots of wooden sit outs available along the shore to enjoy and relax.

The waves breaking on these rocks creates a lovely sprinkle in the air..makes one forget the time. 

That reminds me.. if you visit, make sure you are out by 5 o'clock in the evening. That's when they close the gates.

Would have liked to spend more time here,Maloptera,"Beaumaris, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,04-May-16,"We did a day trip to Chidiya Tapu and enjoyed it a lot but as we were there in the middle of the day it was very hot. The beach is done very nicely with changing rooms, showers and shade huts but if the tide is out, there is not enough water in the ""safe swimming area"" to actually swim, and the shallow water also got incredibly hot. There is some snorkelling in the nay but may be difficult to find unless you know where and you'd have to be happy about swimming out into the middle of the bay...there are lots of crocodile shaped logs in the water and the vis was not so good, so we probably did not go far out enough for the better stuff. Also beware sunburn! There is also the small zoo, which seems to be in the process of expanding...the map at the front gate is quite misleading. We spent some time looking for the butterfly house and reptile house before realising they hadn't been built yet! But it's still nice for a stroll and to see some really awesome trees. More",Apr-16

Bathing in the sea has to be undertaken with caution as salt water crocodiles have been known to frequent the area. I did not spot one!

You should travel little further to reach the Munda Pahad to see the beach there. I would rate that this should not be missed when you visit Chidiya Tappu. The reflection of sea and the mountains on the Rutland Island make a great viewing of sunset from Chidiya Tappu

One can do some little trekking from the shore of Chidiya Tapu to Kala Pathar passing through dense forest. 5. if you are visiting in the afternoon, try to reach this place before 4:20 pm, otherwise, you might miss the sunset.

However, I found the beach to be quite average, with the rocks spoiling the look of it. There was a group playing loud music on the shore, destroying the calmness imminent in the surroundings, annoying to say the least. We settled down on some wooden benches for some photos and then wandered in the shallow, rocky waters where we saw a Stingray up close !

The beach is located on the furthest Southern tip of South Andaman Island 25 kms South of Port Blair and takes about 45 minutes to get there by car. The road traverses through dense jungle/rainforest that opens up along the coastline in a few places. It is the best picnic spot near Port Blair and one should not miss. We visited this place two times during our visit. We enjoyed lot in the park simply by sitting and viewing the beauty of this location.This area itself will satisfy the purpose of Andaman visit.

Ignore,SamirKhan85,"Hyderabad, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,13-Apr-15,"There isn't anything thats great here and nothing much to look forward to. Can be conveniently ignored on your trip to Andaman. Holds no value, is 45 minutes drive from the city and only burns a hole in your pocket.",Apr-15

Good half day out,Parosite,"Paros, Greece",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,03-Apr-15,"Another good half day trip and pretty much the cheapest one if you get stuck in Port Blair. The government bus can take you out there for a few rupees. You will be left close to the Forest Department Resthouse. Walk inland for a couple of minutes and you will find yourself in front of the Nature Park. We usually don’t like zoos, but this one was really low key and quite enjoyable, with few animals in large enclosures, all in a natural forest setting. Our friends visited with children, who absolutely loved it. 
From there it is a 20 minute walk South to get to the beach. Nice picnic spot and good to socialize with locals. As beaches in the Andamans go pretty disappointing, but we just got back from Radhanagar, so could consider ourselves a bit spoilt. More",Feb-15
Sunset paradise,ashwinbhatt,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,02-Apr-15,A great place to view the sunset. You are allowed to stay at the Munda Pahad beach only till 5PM though. There is a long stretch of road from where you can view the beautiful sunset. We were unlucky as we were there on a very hazy day with lots of clouds. In spite of that the sunset was quite spectacular.,Mar-15
Nice place for bird lovers but very over-rated beach,apgoyal,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,02-Apr-15,"We took a Local bus from port blair to chidiyatapu on afternoon. The bus charges 20 rs and drop you 2 km away from the beach. we walked till the beach and found that is very over rated. you can't go in water as it has crocodiles . we just sat there and observed birds in jungle. 

Basically go there only if you are huge fan of birds and want to observe them otherwise there is not much to do on this place . 
we saw sunset and planned to return to our place in port blair by taking an auto ride back",Feb-15
The most beautiful sunset I have ever seen,Priyanjana D,"Calcutta, West Bengal, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,29-Mar-15,"I have been told, that we were lucky to see one of the most beautiful sunset panorama there is. I don't what makes Chidiya Tapu so special, but we happened to see the sun set in the Chidiya Tapu Marine Park accidentally, when we were returning from Cinque island, and our boat could not make it to the dock because of the low tide. The sunset was red , gold, pink, orange, with a hue of green. It was beautiful and I was at peace. 

The Park by itself is not much; the water is clean and cool, and when the tide is low it recedes pretty far from the actually beach, and you can walk pretty far in the shallow water. But it is the sunset which pretty much had us all mesmerized (see picture in post). I wish I had a better camera to capture all the hues. Words are simply not enough. More",Mar-15
Excellent experience at an amazing sunset beach,sanjay_ska,"Greater Noida, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,28-Mar-15,"Chidiya Tapu (Bird Island) is 45 minutes by a cab from Port Blair. Plan your visit to reach there at least an hour before sunset time because Chidiya Tapu has an amazing sunset beach. What you see is an amazing riot of colours as the sun dips behind a background hill with an expanse of water in front. Mesmerising view. The entrance to the beach has eco sit outs for visitors with log cut seating and 'sofas' dug out of 'sea mohva' tree trunks. A few swings keep the children occupied. What is wonderful is that the beach and forest has been kept off limits of food stalls and vendors that normally dot so many other beaches in India. Result = an unlittered beach and unpolluted forest. 
Adjacent to it is the Munda pahad ( a forested hill). A 1.5 kilometre trek through a mangrove forest gets you to a view point at the island's souther tip which gives amazing views of the sea on three sides. More",Mar-15

A nice picnic spot.,shweta_srii,"Hyderabad, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,24-Mar-15,"I wasn't impressed with the beach as i visited there upon my return from Havelock on my last day of the trip. 
To me it was a nice and serene picnic spot and the park is done in an aesthetic manner very close to nature. What I appreciated was the concern of a jhalmuri seller that we should throw the waste paper in bins and not litter. Such attitude of the inhabitants help to maintain the cleanliness of the place. 
The drive from the city is quite scenic too.",Mar-15

Third rated Shoreline,dpmurthy,Kuala Lumpur,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,19-Mar-15,"This place is part of the itineraries of my package tour of the Andaman island.I wont classify it as a decent beach, merely a shoreline which you can find anywhere around the coasts, infested with boulders both onshore and offshore.It is nowhere compared to Radhanagar beach, for the matter, not even close to Elephanta Beach in Havelock Island.The water is not clear and the shoreline is dirty with rubbish scattered all over the place.If your intention is to swim or go snorkelling, then dont waste your time here,rather spend it wisely in Havelock Island.There are lots of fallen trees along the coastline,I suppose its the destruction caused by tsunami.The only positive thing about this place is sunset watching at sunset point which is acceptable, otherwise pack your bags and leave without a second thought.

The road that must be traveled!,Ketan C,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,19-Mar-15,"Been here many a times over 2 visits to A&N. August 2005 & August 2014. More than the actual place itself, the drive to Chidiyatapu is really good. The road runs along the coastline and many a times, the winding road suddenly opens up to reveal the azure, blue sea shimmering in the sunlight. Then of course you enter dense forest which awes you seeing the sheer height of the trees and the diameter of the trunks. While Chidiyatapu itself boasts of little more than a stretch of beach, the surroundings have become much cleaner, and in a 'hats off' moment to whoever had the idea, they have carved out benches and tables out of the giant trees that were felled by the tsunami. Yes, there are no eating joints around so one would do well to carry snacks and beverages. Otherwise, just a couple of kilometres before reaching the place, there is the Wildgrass Resort on the right hand side. It's a little off the main road but doesnt disappoint you with its food, charming location and its beer! Perfect to relax and while away the afternoon before catching a glimpse of the setting sun and heading back to Port Blair! More",Aug-14

On top the world,ShankhaSubhra,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,18-Mar-15,"I felt as if I was on the top of the world when trekked the hills. 

The picturesque view from this place was fabulous. The throw towards the open sea gave an awesome epilogue to our Andaman visit. 

The height and the view from the topmost part of Chidiya Tapu is something which can't be explained by words...it's something which can only be perceived. 

The sunset, though I wasn't lucky enough to get the entire episode, is again one of the attractions of the place. The uprooted trees are very similar to Wandoor, score better, as were ideal for family photo. 

The entire hang-out is one of the favourites of the island. 

On the way back to city there was a place where the rocks are naturally formed like apes, is again quite splendid ""nazara"".

:-(,Naz X,Kazakhstan,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,14-Mar-15,"I had a good imagination in mind about this beach and especially about the sunset reading articles etc but as soon as we reached the place I couldnt hide my disappointments.... crowded, dirty area, disgusting WC (some friends had to use and got seriously sick afterwards), even changing rooms are used as toilets, no comments..... the beach is definitely not for swimming and relaxation because of ""Be aware of crocodiles"" sign and the sunset point is not any better or different than other places. It was a waste of time travelling all way down for more than an hour but now I at least know how the place looks like in reality and tick the box and to those who still want to go would recommend to visit Chidiya Tapu before visiting the Radhanagar beach, save the best for last :-) More",Jan-15

They do have dedicated swimming area, and for real enthusiasts, the crowd wouldn't matter.

We did Squba diving there unlike other who do it in Havelock and we certainly enjoyed every moment of it, esp since we were the only ones in the wide blue sea. Infinity Squba are the providers of this sport there and they were good at what they did.

Its on the East side of the Island and surprisingly, its known for a sunset... not sure why. The beach is nice to swim in and while its High Tide, one can really go deep in and swim. One however needs to be careful as the current can be rough and the corals are sharp. The beach is neat and tidy. More of a couple's joint.

Pleasant for picnic and sunset-point,yojana78482,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,17-May-14,"We went to the beach near Chidiyatapu and it was a very rocky beach. Although the water is very clean there are hardly any waves and the sea-bed is too rocky and hence could be dangerous. Also there are changing rooms but no water supply there. We could see small fishes even in shallow water, otherwise it's a good beach to sit on the shore and enjoy and there are a lot of trees/shade where there was a lot of crowd, mostly locals come there like a picnic. Wouldn't suggest it to people who want to have a tranquil and laid back time.

We went to this point from our hotel, a good 1 hour's drive.This point is a sunset point overlooking the ocean and hills, and a very calm and quiet place. On days without any clouds, sunset here is said to be the best across the Andamans. It was truly a very serene experience, and we enjoyed the sunset sitting on large stones a couple of metres into the sea. 

If one is coming here all the way from Port Blair, then it does make sense to leave a little early to have a dip at the Munda Pahad Beach 2-3 km away from Chidiya Tapu. An extremely good beach, with white soft sand and absolutely clear water. There are hardly any waves so children can enjoy the shallow waters for a distance. There were some interesting warning signs at the beach, for crocodiles and sharks, but there is a huge boat patrolling the waters and nothing to worry. 

Worth spending the latter half of the day here. More",Mar-14

Nice unusual sunset but the ambiance around wasn't nice,beautifuldrug,"Pune, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,09-Feb-14,"The sunset here is different from what you'd see at a regular beach because you have a mass of water in the foreground, and the sun that sets behind a mountain (from the next island). So you get to see a very mirror-like reflection of a golden yolk upon the water which is still -- more like a lake than an ocean really! 

We paid 1500 for the return trip from Port Blair which was arranged by a woman in Port Blair who runs a restaurant near the Bazaar. However we later discovered that a cab would cost 800 Rs for the return trip! OUCH! 

Do not buy stuff from the sellers at Chidiyatapu.. The old guy in a shop marks prices on his stuff so you believe its a fair price. He also writes 10 percent discount but you'll be paying 3 times more..Better to buy your handicrafts from the sellers near the Clock Tower (opposite Supply Lane entrance) at Port Blair 

Only Indian tourists who've turned that sitting area into a garbage dump are to be found here! It's a shame because the sunset is beautiful.. Tourists love the kela bhajiyas (banana fritters) you can buy from the street vendors More",Feb-14

The snorkeling trip organised near munda pahad was good. The best thing was the trip was not much expensive compared to what we were getting in Havelock.

Sun would always like to set here.. So serene and romantic..,doctor-indyeah,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,25-Aug-13,"This place is 25 km from Port Blair and is a usual part of Andaman Itinerary. To visit this place, you need an afternoon till evening sunset. 

The place is a perfect example of the serenity of nature, unspoiled by mankind. A few huts and the reclining beach chairs blend with nature and are made with natural materials. No wonder why sun too gives an amazing setting view here. 

The beach is so artistic by itself, with a tinge of sorrow with fallen trees around, a few lone rocks emerging from the calm enclosure of Indian Ocean and a very thick vegetation opposite to it. Nature boasts here style statement here with the combination. 

One tea stall with a few snack options is the only eatery you'll find here. That too is mobile and starts by evening. Spend a few hours staring at the sea from a wooden long chair, under the canopy of tall evergreen trees, with only the noise of cool breeze patting you to sleep.. Ah!! I miss that place like anything. 

For people who have come early and wanting to do something extra can visit a Zoological Park near the beach. More",Feb-13

My soul felt so pure and positive that time as if i am washed away by all the negativity and noises of the world. Felt so happy and in the lap of divine nature. 
The landscape was so pure and perfect. Everything from the branch of the tree to the pebbles and white sand were so enchanting. Munda pahad is a true beauty. 
I was surprised to see the beach is so different than other beaches. Here the water is calm without much waves. U can walk deep into the water still the water will reach to your knees only.U can hear the music of the birds and pure air touching you. 

This is the place to rest..try to give time to YOUrself only.

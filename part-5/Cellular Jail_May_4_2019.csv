In the evening, a light and sound show takes place in the jail describing the history. 

We took a guide to explain the monument to us, however it was disappointing experience. The guide was supposed to explain to us, but he allowed too many people to join in, to the extent of more than 50 people. As a result, we just walked away from the group and explored the place on our own. 

There is a light and sound show which is conducted in the evening. It explains the place in great details. It is slightly long but definitely worth attending. All and all must visit if you are in port blair. More",Mar-19

We reached during lunchtime and had to wait for the entire duration before it opened up. However, upon entering we found out that it was worth the wait. The sacrifices, the oppression, the brutality meted out to the freedom fighters and inmates of the then jail was documented in the galleries. The life of the inmates was so bad that our excitement turned into sadness. The jail is a silent reminder of the struggles and sacrifices of our forebearers due to which we are enjoying a free and happy life today. The information signboards are put up everywhere on the jail premises and one would have no difficulty in navigating through the premises. Also, the signboards are very informative and you may skip hiring a guide. We also purchased tickets for a light and sound show which is organised every evening, in which the history of the jail is narrated in a very engrossing manner.

You can also take the phone number of any auto driver, and he would be available for you whenever you call. The city is very safe and you can roam about without any fear of being harrassed or mugged.

Amazing lesson on history,Dhaliwal64,"Vancouver, Canada",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,22-Feb-19,"This is a jail that is reminder of what lengths the british went to control the freedom fighters of India who wanted India’s freedom. While the brutality shown to the prisoners was no different than cruelty shown to other prisoners in others parts of the world at the time, the fact that the families of these prisoners did not know if they were dead or alive was excessively cruel. 

For me this was a history lesson and to then meet people who were decedents of these freedom fighters as indeed a treat. 

The facility is a heritage site and it is very well maintained and restored. The light show in the evening is a must see to get a full understanding of what went on in that facility. Being Sikh, I was surprised to learn that more than 10% of the prisoners were Sikh when Sikhs only represented 2% of Indian population. More",Feb-19
Makes one understand the atrocities of British,KSNAR,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,22-Feb-19,"It is a place where your patriotism is put to test.

Panoramic view of Andaman Sea from roof of jail building. 
A museum inside the premises gives good insight into the history of the jail and the atrocities committed by the Britishers on the prisoners. 
Light & Sound show in the evenings is good, but the narrative is exact replica of what is there in the museum. No additional new information on offer. 
Youngsters can't identify themselves with the historic importance of this monument and can't visualize the brutality that freedom fighters faced.

Of course as an Indian I felt patriotic after visiting the jail and seeing the harsh conditions that the freedom fighters lived in.That apart the place is not impressive.The sound and light show in the evening is also only average.

This Jail is just the place one should see when in Port Blair. It is a National Memorial. Do not forget to see the Jail Museum, the Gallows, the factory, the cells of those on the death row, the central tower, the various wings and finally the cell of Veer Sarwakar. In addition the gallery of Andaman in Olden Days and the War of Independence Gallery (Presently under renovation). The place is eerie, and gives you the goosebumps. The wings are made in a manner that no one prisoner could talk to the other, be in within the same wing or another wing. The Central Guard Tower is from where all the wings spread out from. The wings are of unequal length, due to the proximity of the sea to the wing during construction. Do not forget to take a guide, it would be useless without a guide. 4 of the 7 wings of the Jail have been destroyed in an earthquake, the area is now a hospital, which is visible from the top of the Jail.

Sends a chill down your spine!,sumipratap,"Chennai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,12-Nov-18,"The history of Cellular Jail is well known and needs no prologue. With around 693 cells, gallows, bell tower and an oil mill, the structure is mammoth and exceeds all expectations. My tour inside the cells were tormenting and exhaustive, for one reason the rooms were so tiny and lonely and the history comes back to haunt you. Except for the cell of Veer Savarkar, the rest were bland and needs no explanation. The cells are identical. The small model of the Cellular Jail gives a clear picture of the huge structure built during the colonial regime. 

The walk down the gallows was spine chilling and horrific. One can still feel the scent of blood in the air, in the horrid gallows. 

Dont forget to pick some curios on your way out at Sagarika. 

One piece of advice is to attend the light & sound show before going on a tour of the jail.

Guides take just Rs.200/- and give us valuable information about martyrs. 
I would suggest to future travelers to visit this place, try yourself to remain behind the bars in those lonely barracks for few minutes, and just try to think the pain and hardship our freedom fighters suffered that time. 
Its extreme contradictory that visiting cellular jail is to tribute Indian freedom fighters. And visiting Ross island is a bunch of dilapidated places (church, kitchen hall, government house, bakery, press, swimming pool, bathrooms) where Britishers once stayed, to punish / torture to death those Indian freedom fighters...

Do make it a point to stay for the light and sound show. It is very informative and helps you understand the story behind the Jail; linking it up to the politics and administration of the British Raj.

A lifetime experience!,Amrita J,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,28-Jun-18,"Sacrificing one's life for the good of others is sheer greatness.And when it comes to one's country, its freedom fighters hold utmost respect in the society and the future generations should be enlightened about the pain, sufferings and struggle they went through. We owe our freedom or for that matter every little aspect of our daily lives we enjoy to those martyrs. Cellular Jail reminds us of this and the light n sound show throws more light on their life of toil. 

I must say you ought to visit it if you are in the Andamans. The story-telling (sound effects ) of the show is amazing. Though I would like to point out that the light effects are quite average. 

The place is well maintained, though there are portions of the jail which has dilapidated. The objects which our freedom fighters used to extract oil and other instruments are kept well and give you an insight into their painful everyday struggle. If you are an emotional person, you are bound to shed few tears seeing all this. I was greatly moved. I could not thank enough those great lives. 

You can go around the place and see all the cells where the patriots were confined. Taking pictures is allowed. 

It is in Port Blair and you can take local transport to reach. A must place visit.

Next day we went to watch in the day light and we were overwhelmed by emotions just by thing about the dreadful past of that place. I tried clicking pictures but then didn't feel like , some it felt disrespectful to get in cell and click pictures or to click pictures of the places 100's of my countrymen were hanged till death. 

Location wise it is as beautiful and picturesque as it gets. Specially they let you climb to the top and the view is amazing from there. 

the only thing that I didn't like was that only 3 of the blocks of the jail are reaming out of the 7 and they have broken the 4 blocks, not sure why.

The silence of the jail says it all!,radhikasuneeth97,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,22-May-18,"Also known as 'KALA PAANI', it was a British-run prison which used to hold Indian freedom fighters as prisoners. Once you enter the prison, you will feel that sense of eerieness creeping up on you! The cells were arranged in such a way that none of the prisoners were able to communicate with each other and the cells overlooked the sea, which instilled a sense of 'no-escape' to the prisoners. There is also a work shed where the prisoners used to work on oil extractions and rope making, where they had to achieve a certain target (nearly impossible targets), failing which they had to face severe punishments. And of course, any prison would have the facility of the gallows where the prisoners used to be hung and their cries would psychologically impact the other prisoners. In the evenings, there is a light and sound show (audio), which narrates the woeful stories of certain prisoners and their misunderstandings with the British soldiers. This show is available in Hindi and English, although there are a lot more shows in Hindi than English.

Blood Curdling Experience,ShreyaA127,"Chinhat, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,23-Apr-18,"This place needs to be visited by all to instigate the feeling of pride. It has a beautiful view from the top but at the same time, the sufferings and agony of that of bygone freedom fighters make the place feel so much soaked in pain. The best thing about the place is that the guides here are well informed and convey you the whole story with so much conviction that you are bound to feel the pain of that time. The price is pretty reasonable and fixed so there erupts no complexities. 

Other than that the light and sound show is very well scripted but given the time when technology has made such a boom in all the spheres of life, 
it needs some improvisation. I believe it’ll be a bigger hit if complemented with better techniques of conveying. 

The top of the Tower gives you the beautiful view seeing into the vast endless ocean surrounded by coconut and palm trees. More",Apr-18

Just before exit of Cellular jail you can find a souvenir/emporium shop run by Andaman Government.Please ensure you keep the invoice of goods bought with you as the checking officials at Port Blair airport may ask for it.They can confiscate some goods if proper invoices are not there. 

Please plan to reach cellular jail by 8:45 Am to beat the extreme heat later.Else it may be better to reach cellular jail by 3:00-3:30 Pm.We reached cellular jail at 9:00 Am and it was not at all crowded, but after 10:00 Am i could see a huge number of tourists visiting cellular jail.Please respect the place and maintain silence as i could see a craze for taking selfies and pictures with tourist groups shouting and seemingly having fun. 

Cellular jail can be covered in about one hour.From the top of jail Ross Island and North bay Island are clearly visible. 

Light & sound Show: 

There are three light & sound shows daily which starts at about 5:30/5:45 pm.Each has a duration of about 35-40 minutes. The first two shows were in Hindi,not sure if the third was in English or Hindi. Getting tickets for Light & sound show is a cumbersome process as we have to go their, download a form in android mobiles ,fill it and submit online.For doing this free WiFi is provided but it is very slow,also 2G(there is no 3G in Andaman)by Airtel is very slow too.After submission a number will be generated which has to be shown at counter and payment of Rs 50:00 has to be made by card.Tourists who don't have android phone will have to depend on others for getting tickets for light & sound show.We reached cellular jail at about 5:30 Pm and tickets for both 5:45 pm and 6:45 pm shows were sold out. But if many people are there who have come for show and not got ticket,the authorities issue manual tickets.For manual tickets one need not download the form in mobile and the ticket cost is same at Rs 50:00 like regular tickets.They can pay in cash and get tickets.The queue for this is at the the ticket counter on left side of cellular jail entrance. Ticket counter for manual tickets for show at 6:30/6:45 pm will be started from 6:20-6:25 pm on-wards(But please stand in queue whenever you reach cellular jail as it gets crowded by the time ticket counter opens ). Not sure if manual tickets are issued for show of 5:45 pm.We got manual tickets for 6:45 pm show.The difference between regular tickets and manual tickets for light & sound show is that, there are chairs for people having regular tickets,manual ticket holders must sit on the grass which is just in front of chairs where regular ticket holders sit.Sitting on grass is also comfortable. But issuing of manual tickets is entirely depended on authorities there and on some days they can deny,that's what i understood from the tourist police who was there. 

People who come early for Light & sound show can sit at Veer Savarkar park which is just opposite Cellular jail. There are vendors selling tea,Chaats etc inside Veer Savarkar park. 

Light and sound show at cellular jail is just Ok and nothing great. If one does not understand Hindi properly then they will not understand what is said during Light & sound show. Light & sound show at Ross Island is much better and worthy watch compared to Light & sound show at cellular jail. I couldn't find auto just in front of Cellular jail after Light & sound Show at 7:45 pm.In case you are not able to find auto in front of cellular jail,Just walk towards right after exit(The road which goes towards Clock tower/Abeerdeen Bazzar) and you will find Auto.It is absolutely safe even at night to walk on these roads. 

Cellular jail is like a must Visit on your Andaman trip and if time permits go for Light & sound show at Cellular Jail as its just Ok. More",Feb-18

Blast from the past!,Sucha07,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Feb-18,"A visit to the cellular jail is a MUST when in Port Blair. Also a MUST is to take a guide along. The place gives you goosebumps when you see the place where freedom fighters were hanged or the way they were made to extract oil. If nothing else the sense of patriotism will go up by several notches so will the respect for the men and women who fought for freedom from the British. 
The cell of Veer Savarkar is of course the highlight of the place and one cannot imagine how he wrote so many books there with cruelty all around. The architecture of the prison is good aesthically - but since it had been made with a mean mind one feels sorry for the inmates who could not see anyone else from their cells. 
The last point one must see is the view of open sea from the top of the prison and you can definitely appreciate the 'breath of clean and fresh air' after touring the prison.. Metaphorically and otherwise. More",Apr-17

Overwhelming Experience,Samir_bedarkar,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,06-Feb-18,"At the outset, the whole experience of being to this place is very overwhelming. The Light and Sound show captures the history very vividly and is conceptualised very well. 
A few important observations to help others and the managers; 

The tickets for the Light and Sound show can be booked online. However, there is a unique requirement to get the same ratified from the Tourism Office a day in advance. This needs to be done away with. People should book online and carry a hard copy if required. Some percentage of tickets can be kept aside for offline or over the counter purchase. This will save lot of hassles. Especially for people who aren't aware of this rule. 
Secondly, mobile phones/ cameras should either not be allowed or photography be banned during the show. It's very irritating to see mobile flashes during the show. 

But the place is a must visit for sure. More",Jan-18

Amazing harrowing historical landmark,abeerhoque,"New York City, New York",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,20-Jan-18,"This is probably the top sightseeing spot on Port Blair, in the Andaman Islands. I would highly recommend it. It's an old jail that was built by the British in the 1800s. and infamous for its brutal treatment of its prisoners who were worked practically to death and otherwise tortured by malnutrition, thirst, solitary, and floggings. The architecture of the prison is unusual with long corridors of solitary cells fanning out like bicycle spokes from the centre where the guards sat. The museum room gives you all kinds of horrific details about prison life and the struggles of the prisoners as well as the building of the jail. There's also a small art gallery. You can browse the cells, and walk along the tops of the corridors (which have incredible views of the sea from the rooftops - not so much from the jail cells). I didn't know much about Kala Pani (water of death/time, so named for the journey that so few made it back from) and I'm very glad I went. More",Jan-18

It is often the first place to be visited by anyone who is visited Port Blair. 

The Cellular Jail is also, termed as Kala Paani. Kal means “time or death” while Paani means “water“. The dreaded name came about as prisoners who were once shipped across the waters of Andamans were never seen to return. 

The Martyrs Memorial inside the jail will transport you back to the torturous days. The flogging stand, oil mill, gallows and other instruments of punishment are displayed there. There sight might give you goosebumps and make you shudder.

This was a labour camp too, inmates were made to do work as cattle here. Go here to a piece of our history, about how people suffered for the things we take as granted today. 
During season times there are long lines that goes around the buildings on the outside. The waiting time was around 30 minutes. There was a show which goes through the history of the place. The show is told through the mouth of a tree here that is as old as this place. Go to the light house and watch tower for a great view.

There's also a light and sound show (separate ticket) that starts at 5:30 and last for an hour hence the jail visit timings are until 5 PM only. They host 4 such shows and during my visit all of them were housefull with people in the waiting list as well.

This place truly kindles the inner patriotism and uplifts the pride of being an Indian. I visited in the evening for the light and sound show wherein the story of how the Cellular Jail came into existence, Kalapani, and the freedom struggle is narrated using the sound and light techniques. Although, the narration is quite elaborate (around 1 hour), it does give good amount of information about the place. I felt that the show could have been made more interesting and an emotional environment could have been created by using visuals and most updated techniques. The sound and light technique becomes monotonous after some time. there is a lot of room for upgrading the techniques, visuals and creativity needs to be added in order to make it more reachable to audience.

A monument which brings pride and Nationalism,DinkarP16,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,08-Oct-17,"Cellular jail is a place which fills you with pride and deep emotions of the sacrifices made by freedom fighters. 

If you are really interested in soaking yourself in history then you need minimum 90 minutes for the visit of cellular jail and then the sound and light show is there in the evenings. There and 2 shows in the evening starting at 5pm and 3 shows in peak season. Would suggest you go for sound and light show and then go to see cellular jail next day. 

Either prebook ur sound and light show a day in advance or ensure your travel agent books it for you as there is huge rush. 

Please take a guide it just cost 200 rupees and it gives u a very good experience and idea about the history of Kala pani(name given during freedom movement). 

You also have good historical articles and pictures here which you can see. 

From the roof of the cellular jail you also get a very good view of mount Harriet , North bay and Ross Island.

Excellent!!! Words cannot describe,SuchetaM,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,13-May-17,Took a week's trip to Andaman and the cellular jail in Port Blair was the best attraction could ever visit in my life. The light and sound show was much above and beyond my expectations. The story would give you goose bumps. The show is held at night hence it's always advisable to carry some mosquito repellent and some stole to cover your self. I visited in the month of June which i felt was the best time to visit as the rains we're about to start there was not many tourist and also the weather was excellent. The light and sound show is a must watch never to miss. And the tour of the jail is something you would never want to miss once you have attended the light and sound show.

Down Memory Lane,lingarajuds,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,10-May-17,"The cellular Jail of Port Blair is a painful saga of the independence movement. The British wanted to teach the satyagrahis a lesson by putting them in this jail which is covered by thousands of miles of water. 
Nobody knows how many people came here and how many died. Those who protested the cruelty of the Jailer David Blair are put to hardships such as deoiling, and beaten well on the back so that they are not able sit and sleep for months. 
Savarkar was brought to jail in 1911 and he was there up to 1921. He was kep in cell of 13.5/7.5 sized single windowed room which is very near to gallows so that he could hear the cry of dying. 
The prisoners were given rotten food to eat. If they died by ill health their body was thrown in to the sea. There were 693 cells which are not connected to each other. There were 7 rows of 3 storied cells. Now only 5 is left. 
The government has arranged a sound and light show everyday at 6.30 and 7.30. This brings the then situation in the voice of Om puri. 
I am very much depressed by that the attitude of the travellers even after hearing the sad stories of independence movement rushing to take selfies. More",May-17
Key piece of history of our independence struggle,sherlock0079,Bangalore,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,10-May-17,"The cellular jail structure (what remains of it) has been maintained well. The Veer Sarvarkar cell is one of the central attractions. The exhibits on the atrocities committed on the prisoners make a lasting impression on one's mind. The view out into the ocean from the terrace of the jail is excellent as well and attracts the photogenic couples that throng this island. The light and sound show (I watched/heard the Hindi version) is designed to impress upon today's generation of citizens, the courage of the political prisoners housed here and doesn't mince words when describing the cruelty and oppression of the British Raj and its nominees - the jail wardens. 

The only bad point I felt was the ticketing system for the light and sound show. You have to connect to the intranet (local LAN) hosted by the Jail's wifi router and log your credentials, including the serial number of the currency notes you are going to pay. Then you provide a confirmation number at the ticket window with the cash to get your actual ticket. Obviously designed to prevent sale in black by touts, this could be made simpler. The patchy wifi connection and lack of proper instructions posted near the ticket counter make this a troublesome affair. 
And there are no decent snacks/beverages to be had near the jail, save the poor quality chat items peddled by couple of enterprising individuals. More",Apr-17

Must visit National Memorial,ABHISHEK B,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,23-Apr-17,"Without a doubt, Cellular Jail is the must visit in Port Blair. This jail holds a very significant place in the Indian Independence chapter. This jail was opened up in the year 1906. It’s named cellular because it is entirely made up of individual cells for the solitary confinement. Originally, there were 7 rows of 3 storey corridors cells but, now just 3 sets are standing. The other 4 corridors had been damaged. While you enter you can see two museums on either side. You must visit these museums to understand the torture and pain the freedom fighters had gone through in the hands of Britishers. While visiting the jail, you can visualise and understand the inhuman situations where-in our heroes were kept. The museums tell you the stories of inhuman tortures that the Britishers had done to the freedom fighters. 

At the night they organize a fantastic light and sound show. The two shows happen a 6PM and 7PM respectively in HINDI. So, if you don’t understand Hindi, you can consider skipping the show. In the show, they light up entire cell and narrate the history of the Cellular jail. If you understand the language then definitely go for this show. I would recommend going for the 7PM show, as most of the crowd targets the 6PM show. Video recording and photography during the show is not allowed. More",Apr-17

4. Well we were a family of four so we managed to obey the lines and the rules and managed to see the light and sound show. It is Rs.50/- per person. These tickets, I learnt later, could be purchased by your tour operator or hotel manager 3 days in advance by providing a photocopy an adhar card or some other identity proof 

The light and sound show is good for about 25 minutes; but then it starts to get boring as the narrative isnt exciting enough. Unfortunately there is more sound and less of light. 

5. It should be on your first day iternary once you land. You could land and head for the jail straight away, having dropped your bags at the hotel on the way. 
You have to be prepared to be in a sombre mood. Dedicate your first day to a good cause. More",Mar-17
excellent history lesson. well maintinaed,shritimerchant,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,20-Mar-17,"I was very keen to visit it as we’ve all heard so much about the jail, but the magnanimity of history really hits you only once you actually walk along the corridors and pass the tiny 12*14 inch solitary cells. Can’t imagine how terrible the lives of the prisoners must have been and how brave they must have been to willingly go through all this for a bigger cause-freedom; something which take soooo much for granted. They’ve maintained it well, and have kept the actual gallows and flogging and work areas intake- sent shivers down my spine! Def a must visit for a lesson in history.

The cellular jail memorial was opened by 
PM shri Morarji Desai on 11 Feb 1979. 

Kala pani means water of death or a place of death from where nobody returns. Freedom fighters were deported to Kala pani to face unheard trials and tribulations and to lead a life that was worth than death penalty. 

The jail is fashioned as the spokes of the wheel with the watch tower in the middle. 

You can visit the cells of the jail and be ready to feel the eerie feeling that comes with it. You can feel the pain that the freedom fighters had to go through for years together. The place reminds you of the unsung heroes of the freedom struggle. It's a must visit because you can never experience the pain by reading books on Kala pani as you can do by seeing with your eyes. 

The veer savarkar cell is highlighted and you can also enter it. The light and show is in the evening, however it should be re invented as it has got outdated.

Generally a 2 Hr visit is ok excluding light and sound show. Jail has many things in its heart admin block, punishment cells, prison it self, famous Savarkar cell and many details that you may not explore on self. It is better to a hire a guide. Its economic Rs 200 for a family/small group.

Do visit savarkar cell and top of central unit. 

Regarding light and sound show you have two shows @ 5:30 PM and @ 6:45 PM 1 hour each. Do verify your show language as on weekdays they have one show in english and other in hindi. Show is good, informative and more of story telling with good light effects but no visuals or graphics using lights. So plain background lights and sound.

The light and sound show in the evening is not one of the best I have seen. However the narration of what went on in the jail is what sets it apart.

Would recommend to visit in the late afternoon so that one can visit the jail premises & also witness the light & sound show in the dark, which starts at 6.30pm. 
Only few suggestions to the tourism authority at this spot.....(1) With due respect to the martyrs, the authorities should not allow photography at the gallows room.... utter disrespect to the deads while clicking smiling selfies with the gallows in the background. (2) The light & sound is terrific experience but the description is only in chaste Hindi, what about the Indians / foreigners who do not understand Hindi.....this should be done in English too, to reach out to maximum tourists....both the above points are my personal opinions.

A nice history attached to this jail and also, most of the people came with family feels really informative here. It is a big area and will take 1-1:30 hours to complete the full ground.

After my maiden visit to this place i now cherish our Independence much more than ever. I would definitely recommend this place to all my fellow India....After all India's Independence did not come cheap. It was bought by the blood and sweat of these great men. More",Feb-17

Port Blair's Best sight,SueKot,"London, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,18-Feb-17,"It is somewhat ironic that it is a jail which is the best place to visit in Port Blair. The front of the jail has been retained yet only three of the radiating wings remain, the rest being demolished for a hospital. 

It is possible to access almost all of the buildings. It is known as Cellular Jail for the individual cells which characterise the various wings. These wings radiate from a central tower and one may climb to the top for good views. 

A gallows shed is one of the individual sights within the complex. It has three nooses suspended over the traps with the lever alongside. There are also two displays; one for old photographs and the other for a history of the prison 

The jail has a grim reputation and place in Anglo-Indian history. Given the remote location of the Andamans it was used for political prisoners. The regime was tough, if not brutal but no more so than British prisons of the period. 

Talking with our local guide we shared the sad comments about how this history is no longer appreciated by younger people. 

Note that there is also a son et lumiere presentation. More",Feb-17

It feels wrong to enjoy this place,Utkarsha,"Thane, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,22-Jan-17,"The idea of turning the jail into a museum, I suppose, is to act as a reminder of times past.

Recommended if you would like to see Savarkar's history and click some good pictures of the surrounding area from the watchtower.

Slice of history,Raja S,"Chennai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,15-Jan-17,Visited cellular jail and the light and sound show in January.

God bless the brave souls who fought with such integrity. The museum at the entrance enumerates few evidences of what occurred within the jail. You should not need a guide if u have done your homework. Don't miss out to go to the top for a beautiful view of the beach. The light and sound show is poorly done and is disappointing.

Light and sound show pretty bland,RohitRB,"Pune, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,03-Jan-17,"Let me say one thing first - we could visit the Cellular jail only for the light and sound show. Cox and Kings mismanaged our trip so bad that we didn't get a chance to visit this place during the day. So I will stick only to the light and sound show in this review. 

The light and sound show is pretty bland and not made very interesting. In contrast, the history lessons that our guide gave us at the Viper island were so much more heartfelt and filled with emotions. 

Why should you visit this then? 
1) Even if the show is bland, it helps educate the tourist regarding the dark history of the Andaman islands during the British rule 
2) It's one of the most iconic structures in Port Blair. It kind of completes your Port Blair visit (or so I think) 
3) The light and sound show happens in the evening (6PM and 7PM) by when it gets dark in the Andamans. So, there's not much else that you can do either in Port Blair More",Dec-16
Feel the patriotism in every brick and mortar !,ShreyaK15,"Bangalore, Karnataka, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,03-Jan-17,"This place wreaks havoc on your conscience. The feeling that without the present day hustle-bustle of Port Blair how secluded the place would have been when the patriots like Veer Savarkar, Mahavir Singh were being torn from their body and flesh everyday can only be experienced and not explained. The spoke-like structure of the jail from where emanates its seven wings whisper the strength of these great men enduring throughout their lives with nothing but one agenda --- Independence of our India. The next would be a tear in your eye for the reason if our present truly deserve their sacrifices! Nonetheless, the light-and-sound show usually gets interrupted by the rainfall a regular phenomenon. Don't get scared... Carry an umbrella if possible not necessary though. Run back as soon as it's over. I believe light and sound show can't be done in a closed space and that's why. Plus the later part of the show have more flair and rage and effects... !

Though I know Hindi, in some places, it was tough to follow.. we'd prefer to go and see it again in English..

A journey back in time,Kishore B,Bangalore,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,27-Dec-16,"The Cellular Jail was constructed by the British during their rule over India to incarcerate die hard freedom fighters, the infamous ""kalapaani"". The 'sound and light' show in the evening transports one back in time. It cronicles the history of the islands, the settlements in Port Blair region, the cellular jail, the jailors and its inhabitants. The major part of the show highlights the hardships inflicted by the British on the freedom fighters incarcerated. 

The show can be a bit shortned by eliminating the many patriotic songs.",Nov-16

Mesmerised by the narration!,Raghu21,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,22-Dec-16,"Sound and light show is a MUST visit activity in Port Blair. No trip to Andamans will ever be complete without this. The story of the events at the Andaman cellular jail, narrated through the eyes of an old Banyan tree is simply mesmerizing.

Only two of the seven buildings now stand.. the models of the rice mills and the chains and fetters send shivers down your spine. the gallows are still there. Veer Savarkar's cell on the 2nd floor is also to be visited... however, the sound and light show in the evenings is not that great and becomes a bit monotonous. in case you want to see the sound and light show, make sure your tickets are booked ..and there are no seat numbers so it is a free for all for the seats.

Memorial to our brave feedom fighters,LazyToTravel,"Chennai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,24-Nov-16,"To tell the truth, the visit to Cellular Jail was a bit depressing for me. 
Seeing all the tiny cells in which our brave freedom fighters were forced to stay, cruelly segregated from each other, seeing the condemned cells where those sentenced to die spent their last hours, seeing the actual places where they were hanged and their bodies were unceremoniously dumped into the sea, seeing the places where and the methods with which they were tortured mercilessly, really put all of us in a sad and depressed mental state. But it also forced us to appreciate the brave efforts of all our freedom fighters who untiringly fought against their cruel British oppressors. 
There used to be seven wings in the jail, each with 99 cells. Now there are only 3 wings left, the remaining were destroyed during Japanese occupation. 
The view from the terrace of the Cellular Jail is really terrific and a good photo spot. 
In the evening, there is a really touching light and sound show where the narrators are the spirits of all the freedom fighters who died there, and also a tree that bore witness to all the horrific events that took place in the jail. 
It is worth a visit, and it may be a good idea to hire a guide at the entrance. Our guide charged us 400 rupees for a group of 14 people. More",Nov-16

The jail had represented death, doom and pain for all those who knew of it and had experienced it. Centrally located, the jail is now a National Monument and has only three wings left of the original seven. Andaman, previously known as Kalapani was where the British Raj stowed away it's prisoners, it's enemies and freedom fighters.. Freedom fighters were common in Kalapani as all those whom the British Raj wished the death of and wanted gone were sentenced to the Cellular Jail of Kalapani. It had seven original wings built in such a way that it represented the spokes of a wheel. Each cell was built in a way that the prisoners could not see who the inmates were in their opposite cell as the opening of each cell faced the back of another. It had a centrally located tower which was interconnected to each of the seven wings.It is a really awe-inspiring structure that once stood as the symbol of the power of the British Raj. What I wasn't in awe of was that one whole wing of the Cellular Jail was demolished to...you guessed it! To build a hospital. That is really a downer. But other than that..you are gonna enjoy it!

It's held in the main courtyard of the jail as you walk in. If you pay for entry to the jail to look around, that's what the chairs are for 

Men and women have to queue separately to buy tickets, the ticket office is only open at certain times of the day, the queue was about 45 minutes long when we went which during the midday sun is not pleasant 

Also the shows are narrated in different languages on different days/times. We didn't realise this and left it too late in our trip, so the only show available was in Hindi. My wife understood it but I just admired the light show and read the story on wikipedia

Having travelled the world, this is nothing even close to a good sound light show. there is an audio playing for 50 minutes and different colour of lights turning on and off on a tree, on walls, inside windows, doors, lobby, etc. there are so many advanced light effects which should be used to enhance the quality of the show rather than a very slow story telling. The sound quality was fine. BUT, the lighting needs to be improved to a great extent.

A historic place With horrific past,Hemik_Parikh,"Surat, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,03-Jul-16,Cellular Jail is the main attraction in Port Blair. Just a word of advice it closes at 4:30 so visit before that. The cellular jail is kept well and 200 bucks paid to guide was worth as we listened to the jail's horrible past and cruelty which the freedom fighters of India endured. The whole tour is great and what caps it is the light and music show which has two shows daily at 7&8 PM. But it's operation depends upon whether conditions. U habe to be extra fortunate to get the tickets of that as tickets are sold just an hour prior the show and queue is long. The view from the upper floor is just breathtaking. More,Jul-16

Great Insight of a Landmark,Gourav99,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,30-Jun-16,"After leaving frm the airport we took a cab and reached 
the jail in abt 10 mins and spent aroung 2 hrs here. 
The jail is very well maintained as taken care of. 
We opted for a guide who charged abt 150 bucks for his 
services but it wouldnt be logical to not hire one. He 
gave a us a grand tour of the entire place along with 
the history of the prison, frm the gardens to the place 
where the prisioners were hung, the places and things 
they had to do as punishments and labor and of course 
the cells they lived in. 

We took a lot of pics here and enjoyed the terrace and 
the watch towers and the amazing views it had. 
I request all u guys to take time and visit this place 
weather ur wid frens or family all are gonna enjoy this, 
trust me on this.

Needless to say, this is a place with so much history, the pain of the residents and the tortures of the inmates that it makes you think of the freedom we enjoy and the struggle the inmates went through to seek it. 
Seeing the Light and Sound show first and then visiting the Cellular Jail the next morning gives you a very good perspective to the visit. Very nicely maintained and you can walk through all the corridors and get into the cells and also visit the gallows. 
One can reflect in solitude in any of the cells and just try to think through the history of the place, a hair raising experience indeed.

Standing testimony to sufferings undergone by Freedom Fighters,Rajesh k,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,25-Jun-16,"The Cellular Jail was a Colonial prison in the Andaman Islands. The British had built this prison to exile Indian prisoners during India's Freedom Struggle. 
This National Memorial monument is three storey building and has around 700 cells. There are no dormitories. Each cell housed a single prisoner. Dormitories were not built to ensure that prisoners are kept in isolation from each other and there is absolutely no communication among them. 

The Britishers tried to create 'Hell' on earth for our Freedom fighters. This Cellular jail was known as Kala Pani which means Death Water. 
Apart from the cells, one can see Hanging rooms which are horrifying and give us a feel of the plight of our freedom fighters. Oil Grinding mills are seen where in prisoners were tied to the handle like bulls and made to move until specific quantity of oil was produced. 

Many freedom fighters were kept here by Britishers, prominent among them were Veer Savarkar and Batukeshwar Dutt. More",Aug-15

It is an amazing place full of history of India's independence movement. It is very well maintained and a pointer towards the cruel ways of the British Raj. 

The light and sound show in the evening is also awe-inspiring and beautifully presented. 

The only problem is getting the tickets for the light and sound show as the counters are jammed by touts and agents who then sell the tickets at higher rates to the tour operators who in turn charge premium rates. Since we travelled on our own, we had to wait for a long time to buy the tickets since the tickets for the first show at 6.15pm were sold out within 15-20 min of the counters opening. Just due to the touts! And the policemen on duty and the ticket counter guys are well aware of this problem but they prefer to show a blind eye to them. We saw the English show at 7.15pm and while waiting for the counter to open, saw the same touts who had bought tickets for the hindi show.

Our freedom has been attained by sacrifices of so many, and how lightly we take it. We keep fighting at work places, in families, and where not? All ego gets shattered when we listen to what tortures freedom fighters went through in those eras. The light and sound program gives goosebumps and big tears. Not much mention of details are made in any textbooks or stories. 

It makes me think that how could one human torture other this way? No religion teaches this. 

If architectural design is to be considered, it is beyond comparison. Escape was just not possible. But the way freedom fighters were punished was much more than barbaric.

What is the extent of harsh? Well I can't put that in words. Architecturally the prison had 7 blocks with one Central control tower offering the only way to enter the prison. The cells are so designed that the prisoner cannot even communicate with any other inmates. Even if they could escape from prison, they would get stranded in open waters. We read about Late Veer Savarkar being one of the prisoners, but were never told that there were hundreds of other freedom fighters who ended up dying the cells.

KaalaPani Horrors,zfr19389,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,20-May-16,"The Cellular Jail in Port Blair was the reason why the otherwise pristine Andaman and Nicobar Islands earned the notoriety of being called Kaala Paani (or black waters). Freedom fighters during the British era who revolted against the British government were deported to this jail located far away from mainland India where they were subjected to unimaginable torture. Not only were the prisoners used to build their own prison, they were also treated in the worst possible way within the walls of this. Distance from the mainland also meant that news of the torture could not easily reach there thus making job of the jailers easy. The most famed prisoner of all was Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, known more famously as Veer Savarkar (the Port Blair airport is named after this famous freedom fighter). 

This attraction has now been converted to a national memorial and even though only two of the seven rows exist (rest have fallen down as a result of earthquakes etc), each cell seems to have a shocking tale to tell. It is a must visit place to rekindle spirit of nationalism and relive those horror moments that our freedom fighters went through while fighting for India's independence. More",May-16

Getting tickets for the sound and light show is another story altogether. The ticket window for the 6.00 pm show opens around 5.15. Tourists and agents queue up in advance. The tickets are sold fast and hence tourists start queuing much before. Some agents sell the tickets in black at a premium of Rs.20/-. But we chose to wait for half an hour in the queue rather than pay such a premium. It somehow did not feel right to do such a thing on such a sacred place. We may not be able to do much for our country but our group refused to insult the souls of the martyrs by indulging in such a illegal activity and that too, to watch a show dedicated to them.

There are several sections in the jail grounds which give visitors a glimpse of the lives of the prisoners and leave you with a sense of pathos. Be prepared to walk around to see all the artifacts in the various museums within the monument. The place is thronged by tourists, especially honeymooners, who somehow see this as a perfect site for a photo-op. Try to steer clear of them and immerse yourself in the history of the place. Guided tours are also available at a fee of course. A light and sound show screened in the evening (2 shows- at 6 p.m. and at 7 p.m.) elaborates the history of the prison, the atrocities on the prisoners and the ultimate triumph of the spirit. The audio is in English so everyone can understand the history with a healthy dose of patriotic songs thrown in for dramatic effect! You need to purchase separate tickets for entry to the Jail (Rs 30 each) and for the light and sound show (Rs. 100 each). The tickets for the light and sound show get sold out very fast so don't be surprised to see people queuing up for the tickets... The Cellular Jail is a must visit in Port Blair. As you walk through the museum and its lawns, the plaques detailing the history leave you nostalgic. The jail is extremely well maintained, neat and clean- a rarity for most heritage sites in India. There are several sections in the jail grounds which give visitors a glimpse of the lives of the prisoners and leave you with a sense of pathos. Be prepared to walk around to see all the artifacts in the various museums within the monument. 

The place is thronged by tourists, especially honeymooners, who somehow see this as a perfect site for a photo-op. Try to steer clear of them and immerse yourself in the history of the place. Guided tours are also available at a fee of course.

Piece of History that will make you realize the cost of freedom,manmohit,"Chandigarh, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,14-Mar-16,A wonderful and a must see place in the Port Blair. You just cannot miss it as this is what the island was known for. Ticket charges are nominal 25 Rs for Indian nationals. It has water and toilets facilities inside.There might not be any action within those walls in the present time however the walls speak of their dark past and the atrocities committed on the freedom fighters of the country. The way the jail was made and designed makes you admire the british management on one hand however it also reflects the kind of control they wanted on every situation. Such hardships were there to ensure that it breaks the backbone of the freedom fighters. I definitely recommend visiting this place and the Sound and Light show is also recommended. More,Feb-16

Well preserved historical monument,SheetalPatankar,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,11-Mar-16,"We visited the cellular jail last month during our trip to Andaman. The monument has been maintained very well-kudos to the management!! I recommend taking a guide as he can explain all the events and places. We had hired a guide who gave us a detailed account of the place and the events -very knowledgeable!! After a 1 hour guided tour we also saw the light and sound show. There are 2 shows every day - 6 to 7 and 7 to 8 in 2 languages -English and Hindi - You need to check before going. Also the jail closes at 5 pm - so we waited for around 45 minutes in a garden right opposite the jail. The line was long as the open air show seats about 300- 400 people at a time. The jail is closed on one day in the week - I cant recollect right now which that is - so check before you plan a trip there. 
It is very sad to hear about the torture that Indian prison inmates were subjected to by British wardens. However children should be shown this and explained the details so that they understand the cost that our freedom fighters paid then so that they can live a carefree life today.

A historical monument - whose experience can be made better,Sachin P,"Bangalore, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,09-Mar-16,"Cellular Jail at Andamans would be in the ""must visit"" list of Indian tourists, as it is mentioned in the history books at schools. The museum is well maintained and it would easily take a person 45mins to 60mins to take a good tour of the prison complex. The ""work sheds"" have all been made into museum galleries and some of them have really old and rare photographs showcasing the life style at Andamans - both of the convicts and the British administrative officials. There is a gallery right at the entrance which has pictures of the people who were incarcerated in this prison. The case against them is mentioned, but it should have been better to include a small write up about the incident. For example there are photos of convicts of the 1921 Moplah riots, but I am sure many of us would not even know what was the Moplah riots, where did it happen etc. It would also be nice to see if any prison records (maintained by the jail wardens, superintends etc.) which are available now, and that can be also displayed. The various prison blocks are let open for the visitor and it is a real eye opener for any tourist to know what a prison looked like in the olden days. And naturally it makes them think about what ""freedom"" actually means. Leave alone the ""freedom fighting"" aspect, but it makes a person realise...

It is only with a small tremor in the heart one would be able to enter the shed which houses the gallows to see the noose and the trap door. And then to go through a side door to a floor below to see where the doctors and jail officials would inspect the hanging body to confirm death. And then right across it is the ""condemned cell"" block where prisoners awaiting death sentence to be confirmed are lodged. These would for sure make a free man give an opportunity to understand what a condemned prisoner would go through mentally and physically. The prison is given prominence mainly due to the incarceration of the freedom fighters, but I feel it is not the only case for importance. A prison always gives a chance for a person to look at the concept of crime and the punishment meted out. 

The ""light & sound"" event at evenings can be easily skipped. For it really does not bring out any aspect which one could not find in the information boards available next to each artifact. The ""light & sound"" show seems to be focussing more on the freedom struggle and lodging of freedom fighters in this prison. But in reality it was not just the freedom fighters who were lodged here, there were convicts convicted for other crimes as well. The show was also not able to clearly give a time line of the existence of this prison. It was mainly focusing on the Jailor David Berry and his exploits. I watched the Hindi version of the show (even though I am not a native Hindi speaker), and understand that there was another English version at 1900Hrs. Rather than the show, the museum can have a small shop which can have books detailing the history of the prison. Or small devices with head phones which can narrate the history, unique aspects of each artifact etc. This system is there at the Museum Palace at Mysore. More",Mar-16

Very interesting but shaky visiting experience,sourosircar,"Sandhurst, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,12-Feb-16,"The cellular jail is a historical memorial for all of the indian freedom fighters who fought and died here during imperial Britain's rule in India. As a descendant of a original Indian person myself, I found this place quite disturbing especially when someone closely related may have been imprisoned here. Apart of that, there is a lot of history and true stories to share during your visit. They allow cameras and camcorders here but a small fee applies, which is well worth it. There is no lift built in the jail and the top of the building is only reachable with some large steps with no hand-rail, which is no problem if you are very mobile. The view from the top and from the main guard tower is wonderful as you can see out for miles. If you have time to spend, be sure to see the light and sound show here in the evening. You can get a ticket at a good price at the main office. The show itself truly tells a tragic but great story of the inmates struggles for freedom from tyranny and hatred and all the hardships ensured throughout time.

The jail also became famous because of Veer Savarkar who was placed in solitary confinement here. His cell is now a memorial itself within the memorial. The jail initially had seven rows having cells thus acquiring its dreaded name. The memorial also houses a mini museum with photographs etc which showcase India's freedom struggle.

1. Ask your guide to be less emotional and talk more about facts (definitely take a guide to walk you through the jail) 
2. Keep 30-45 mins aside for clicking pictures - you can get great shots in daytime 
3. There is a light & sound show conducted at this place at 5:30 PM daily. It is not too great but people visiting generally see. Queue to get tickets for this show starts getting populous by 4:45 PM (at the counter near the jail ticket counter) - please ensure you are in queue in time. 
4. A lot of walking is involved with little to eat around - so have your snacks / food with you (idea to visit just post lunch around 2 PM)

We have read and made to believe that we owe our independence to few of known freedom fighters. The truth of our freedom is hidden here in this Cellular Jail. It is a memorial of hundreds of unsung heroes who sacrificed everything for the freedom of their motherland. While in Pune I visited Aga Khan Palace where Gandhiji was imprisoned by Britishers.I was stunned to see the room where he was kept. It had attached toilet with western commode, wash hand basin, dining area and all the other amenities you can think of. Contrast his imprisonment with those who spent their entire life in a cell measuring 10*7. After seeing all this I strongly feel that we the Indians have been cheated in narrating the truth of our freedom struggle. Must visit to bow your head to all these unsung heroes.

"Cellular Jail, Port Blair, A ""must visit "" place for every Indian visiting Andaman Island.",198pradeep,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,14-Dec-15,"Cellular Jail, also known as ""Kala Pani"", was built by British during ten year period from 1896 to 1906. It was used to jail and ruthlessly punish political dissidents [ India's freedom fighters] during India's freedom struggle. It has an imposing structure with a central tower having breathtaking sea view from it's terrace; and seven very long three storied wings radiating from central tower. Originally it had 698 cells, each used for single prisoners. During the world war II, many wings were destroyed and at present only two wings are preserved. On second floor of one of the surviving wings, a corner cell was used to imprison the great freedom flightier Veer Savarkar, in whose memory The International Airport at Port Blair is named.Visiting this cell and looking at Veer Savarkar's picture inside while recapitulating his epic battles with British was a really a touchy experience. 
the Cellular Jail Complex has many other attractive features such as light and sound show, Central tower, museums dedicated to specific subjects such as pictures of Veer Savarkar, material used in jail, uniforms of convicts and staff, memorial tower and flame etc. Cellular Jail is a ""must visit"" place for every visitor to Andaman Islands.

Try to Visit Early Morning or in Evening,savvyuec,"Hyderabad, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,07-Dec-15,"Port Blair has a hot and humid weather so it is advisable that you visit the Cellular Jail in the morning or in the evening. You need to come in the evening as you should see the Light and Sound show. You may have seen better shows but then each one is unique and therefore I would not suggest that you miss it. Since there is quite a bit of walking to do it would be better to come when the Sun is not at its full glory. 

The roof of the Jail is accessible and also the Tower in the middle and provides a excellent view of Port Blair and the sea nearby. You need at least 2-3 hrs to cover the museums and the other displays so plan accordingly. If there are elderly in the group they could rest somewhere as the stair to the tower may be a bit difficult for them.

The Cellular Jail is located at Port Blair in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands.

Several eminent revolutionaries of India have been imprisoned in this jail, and they include Babarao Savarkar, Vinayal Damodar Savarkar, Barindra Kumar Ghosh and Batukeshwar Dutt amongst others.

The Cellular Jail is today acknowledged as a National Memorial monument. In addition, visitors can also enjoy a Sound and Light show in Hindi as well as in English conducted during evening within the premises of the Cellular Jail. This program depicts the heroic Freedom Struggle and the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters and truly touches the soul of every Indian. The show gives us a brief idea about the brutal happenings in the jail prior to India’s independence and other historical events regarding this place. The place also has a Martyr’s memorial, a museum, and a photo gallery and art gallery as well, reminiscing India’s struggle for independence. 
Best time to visit 
Keeping in mind the moderate and tropical monsoon climate of Port Blair, ideally the best time to visit the Cellular Jail and Port Blair is between the months of October and April. Rest of the year the weather remains unbearable as the summers are hot and humid and winters experience strong winds. 
Trivia 
The Cellular Jail was used by the British Government to deport political prisoners to a secluded archipelago and hence earned the name ‘kala pani’ meaning ‘black waters’. 

The wings of the building were branched out from the central tower like the spokes of a wheel, which were so designed such that the frontal side of a cell in a spoke saw the back of cells in another spoke. This idea was meant to make communication between prisoners impossible. 
Timing 
The Cellular Jail remains open Tuesday to Sunday and is closed on Mondays and during public holidays.

Cellular Jail - The saga of Indian Freedom struggle!!,Jshree2011,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,29-Oct-15,"Cellular jail, now a National memorial, depicts the intense struggle of the Indian freedom fighters. The very moment one enters the cell, can feel their sufferings. The place has been kept very clean though most of the cells are not in quite good shape as it is more than a century old. It had seven wings when it was first built. The spokes are built in such a way so that the face of a cell in a spoke saw the back of cells in another spoke. This way, communication between prisoners was impossible since, they were all in solitary confinement. The Light and sound show is awesome but I couldn't enjoy it as I was in the last row and people kept talking constantly and it was pretty noisy. Guess its better to take a seat in the front row.

The cells built specifically for solitary confinement, the gallows, the watch tower, the bicycle-wheel architecture, the oil mills - tell the story of crime against humanity.

The Freedom fighters bore all the barbarism to get freedom & Independence. At the sound & sight show in the evening narrated by actor OM PURI while listening to the role of the freedom fighters, everyone becomes emotional and gets carried to the bygone era with moist eyes as we felt the brutalities that were perpetrated on the Indians.

I remember it had six or seven long wings. An aerial view may give the picture of the structure in a lovely circle. It looks quite stately in appearance. Its only when one sets foot into the cells with iron gate, the intensity of the place enters into the depth of your being. The feeling of fear comes in without saying. Such a feeling does not go away soon, does it? 
It had around 690 such cells connected with a long corridor, also grilled to the open side. The centre was some kind of watch tower from where surveillance could be done both from the front and back of these wings. It was designed scientifically and aesthetically too. The cells were spacious and the walls were thick. 
I had heard a lot about it but sure the visit was just as good. Many of our freedom fighters were there. Visit them in spirit.

Re inventing saddest part of indian history,Sandesh M,"Bangalore, Karnataka, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,07-Jun-15,"The Cellular Jail is one of the saddest chapters in the history of the colonial rule in India. Although the prison complex itself was constructed between 1896 and 1906, the British had been using the Andaman Islands as a prison since the days in the immediate aftermath of the first war of independence. The construction of the prison started in 1896 and was completed in 1906. The original building was a puce-colored brick building. The bricks used to build the building were brought from Burma. You need at least 2-3 hours to see the entire jail.

It was constructed between 1896 -1906 to use it as prison to keep political prisoners and revolutionaries. Many notable dissidents such as Batukeshwar Dutt and Veer Savarkar, among others, were imprisoned here during the struggle for India's independence. The building had seven wings and each wings had three stories having a total of 693 cells. At the centre of which a tower served as the intersection and was used by guards to keep watch on the inmates. The wings radiated from the tower in straight lines like the spokes of a bicycle wheel. A large bell was kept in the tower to raise an alarm. Each cell 13.5x7.5 feet in size with a ventilator located at a height of three metres. The name, ""cellular jail"", derived from the solitary cells which prevented any prisoner from communicating with any other. Also, the wings were so designed such that the face of a cell in a wing saw the back of cells in another wing. This way, communication between prisoners was impossible. In 1969 the remaining three wings and the central tower were converted into torture machine to a National Memorial.

Now some touristy details - Do pay a day visit to explore the jail and hire the government guide. (they charge only Rs.200 and take you around the whole area). The guide provides good information and details - which you will miss otherwise. You will have to walk quite a bit as the area is huge and there are stairs leading to the upper floors. The museum is decent and is a good place to start. The view from the rooftop of the jail is spectacular.

The unfulfilled dreams, the poignant sighs, and the muffled unheard cries to which this majestic building bears a silent testimony. Horror and heartlessness assumed a new meaning inside these walls.

(lunchtime 1245—1330hrs) 
No one would remember the martyrs or the sufferings, deaths, tortures and the pathetic pointlessness of cruelty of such magnitude being perpetuated by humanity against each other. The unfulfilled dreams, the poignant sighs, and the muffled unheard cries to which this majestic building bears a silent testimony. 

Horror and heartlessness assumed a new meaning inside these walls. For these 'Kalapani destitutes' only two forms of humanity existed, one inside and the other outside.some survived and some died and those are the ones that suffered and died became fully human. 
A jail built by the natives, for the natives , the torture carried out also by the natives and manned by a handful of Britishers. It has no dormitory and only cells giving it its name of cellular jail. 

The jail stands on a small hillock at the centre of the city. At the entrance which use to house the administrative building has been converted into a museum showcasing a gallery of our gallant freedom fighters who martyred their life, meticulously catalogued with their name, deeds, legal battles and snippets of their horror at the prison. Looking at those men you realize that they were men from a different genre with their ideals and morals incomprehensible by the present generation.They embraced death with equal zeal as life and strode the pathway to martyrdom with a song on their lips and their head held high to singularly achieve only one aim—freedom from the tyrannic British rule.One tale of perpetuated horror was really heartrending where the prisoners were forcefed to break their fast and the feeding tube erroneously was forcibly introduced into their lungs and milk was poured down leading to their untimely demise. Horror has no form only meaning and while it prevails nothing exists. The preserved pieces of the door locks, the prison Spartan cotton dresses, the iron chains and locks all fill you up with a sense of suppressed rage. 
The main building has a central pillar with radiating seven rows of three storied buildings like spokes in a wheel with cells. Even the facing walls of adjacent buildings were sealed and plastered to complete the sense of abject desolation.All the floors can be accessed only from the central pillar which had a huge bell at the top which used to be tolled with every execution to the sadistic glee of the colonial rule. 
A normal mind fails to register as to why it was built, how it was built but what seeps in your conscience is that it is a marvel in architectural horror where every brick which was planned and layered down was with the sole intention of inflicting sheer terror both physical and mental to the doomed occupants. 
The most inhuman part of the construction was the last three cells where the prisoners condemned to death row spent their last few days of their life till their death sentences were ratified and from where they had a clear look at the gallows which till today is preserved. 
One has to be a barbarous inhuman truculent human being to perpetuate such heinous acts against humanity which cannot be condemned. 
In the evening the jail lights with a resplendent “Light and sound show”:: Multiple shows starting at 05:30 pm of about an hour as a fitting tribute to the martyrs.. Wonderfully choreographed with stalwarts from Bollywood lending their vocal chords, eerily recollecting the horrific tales, the cruelty of the bygone era spoken from the eyes of a century old banyan tree which actually stood a mute spectator to the horrendous activity.it is a harrowing horrific tale of depraved humanity and the show transports you into that era, where by the time the show ends--leave aside goosebumps you thank God that you were born in an era where you have the most important gift of humanity--freedom.

We visited museum in the morning as it is closed by evening. Once you are in museum do read information on the boards.

It takes about 60 mins to visit all areas of the jail. I felt Galllows, Prison cells actually spoke to me on how much trouble our fighters faced for us. 

Evening light show is also must watch. They give glimpse of main past events of the cellular jail. Lights are really effective to make it mesmerizing.

The Light & Sound show at the jail premises throw a deep insight into British tyranny. Sardonically the place that boasts about such exquisite beauty holds the gloomiest history of all. The cellular jail of Kala Pani, is probably the most tragic historic monument I have visited. With the most amazing views from rooftop the gloomy history makes you feel guilty about admiring this stunning view.

The motive is same, only thing is that time Britishers wanted to rule on us occupying our land, and current days we are fighting to save our own land. ! 

I Felt like even today for the terrorists, rapists, chain snatchers, contract killers should have been kept there and treated with similar efforts which Britishers did would certainly make some more threat among the new generations going on that way and they will think 10000 times before they commit any of these mistakes. 

British govt wanted to make very strict punishments here so just thinking of this, out of 1000 people 999 will back out !! its time to be so hard on any crime that could be bigger picture for us in coming few years and maintain a law & order... 

Swatantraveer Savarkar was on the right top last cell - Worst part is they wrote the patriotic songs there by the screws and pointers but govt has given whitewash there which is so senseless...this shouldn't have been removed at all !!

The list of the names of the freedom fighters from different States of India who was kept there in this jail is inscribed on the marble stones fix on the main central pillar of the jail.The jail is a wonderful place to visit in Port Blair and to know about our freedom fighter, how much they suffered .?. The hanging room, the room where they pull Kohlu whole day to extract about 40 kg of Coconut oil per day, whip room, the last rituals place etc.are such that produces tears in our eyes.

Veer Savarkarji ki Jai,Profvns,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,17-Aug-14,"This Cellular Jail was dumb witness to the tortures meted out to the freedom fighters, who were imprisoned here. It is ‘cellular’ because it is entirely made for solitary confinement of prisoners. I consider it as a pilgrimage centre. That is why I preferred to see it first as soon as I landed on Port Blair. I had read the biography of Veer Savarkar and shed tears for the sufferings he and the prisoners in those suffered at the merciless hands of the British. I preferred to see the ‘cell’ where Savarkar was kept in. I saw it. I sat in front of it. I silently cried for that brave soul, the “Son of Mother India”. More than that I could do nothing. During 19th century it was a great problem for the British to control the mutinies that was occurring often in every part of the British India. At the same time Andaman Islands were used as base to attack them by Japan. Hence the British planned to build a Cellular jail of 698 cells in 1910 to house the political prisoners. The Cellular Jailat in Port Blair was designed for solitary confinement each cell measuring 15 X 9 ft with a single ventilation window 10 ft above the floor.

The still worst jail was Viper Chain Gang Jail on Viper Island. It was reserved for troublemakers. There still stands site of hangings. Later in the 20th century, it was used to house for freedom fighters for India's independence. 
The Jail was originally constructed with seven wings, spreading out like a Seven-petal flower with a tower. Because of the three storeys high seven wings with 698 isolated cells it was called as “Cellular Jail”. Now we can witness light and sound show every day in this Jail premises. The commentator explains the History and atrocities meted out to great patriots who fought for independence of India. 

Cellular Jail is now declared a National Memorial which is a satisfaction for all freedom lovers.

Struggle for Existence,korebio,"Calcutta, West Bengal, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,02-Aug-14,"Cellular jail is one of the most popular spots in Port Blair. This place has been awarded as national monument and it's no longer a jail now. Presently its span in terms of area is less than half of its actual area. There were 8 compartments originally out of which 3 are remaining nowadays and the rest got destroyed by Japanese Bombing. Even today when you enter the actual jail, memoirs from the past will gloom all over you. There are two activities in cellular jail. You can go for a normal roam throughout the jail and all the spots are open for tourists and there is no restricted spot as such. The jail is open from 9 am to 5 pm or 4pm I forgot actually. I would suggest take a guide which will charge 50Rs per head so that you can get to know the exact details and history of the jail although it's not mandatory to take a guide. The entry fee is 15Rs per head and there is extra 20Rs charge for camera. Another attraction is the light and sound show which takes place twice after the normal visiting hour ends. Most of the shows are in Hindi but there are some English as well. You can ask at the counter itself for the language choice. I would suggest go for the light and sound show first and on the next day or later go visit... Cellular jail is one of the most popular spots in Port Blair.

The light and sound lasts for 30 minutes approximately and it is just marvelous (Although personally I liked the light and sound at Golkonda Fort[Hyderabad] better than that of Cellular). Try to grab a sit at the back row because many often during the show the light will point to a tree which is situated at the back. You can make a video of the entire show, no one is there to stop you(In fact I did it). 

You can browse through my pictures to get a better idea of the jail itself. It houses picture of Netaji's Visit to the Jail, Hitler, Gandhiji, Jawaharlal Neheru's rare pictures. It also has a rare thing in collection - The Statesman of 15th August,1947(Only the first page is visible though). You can go to the roof if the jail from where you will get a view of Ross island(Read my review for this island). Only one jail cell is open for public entry(Don;t worry you will not be jailed :P) i.e. Veer Savarkar's jail. There are many dummy sculptures of the prisoners which depict how they were tortured during their prison life. The utensils which were used to feed there are still there. There is one lamp(locally they call it Jag-Pradip) which lights 24*7 throughout the year to pay homage to the martyrs. It's really a nice thing to watch. 

In a nutshell, I would say it's a very well preserved and well maintained area so go for it to get a different taste than conventional Andaman with its beaches. More",Mar-14

I was fascinated to read the copies of British Government notifications allowing primitive punishment methods, addition of new blocks of cells etc. They have done well to preserve all these archives from a century and half ago. 

The sound and light show was also very enlightening but exclusively in Hindi. So foreign tourists may not gather too much from it and infact we only saw local Indian crowd during the show.

All said and done it's a solid construction and shows many nuances for people from mainland. However, I personally did not like the part where they put the gallows for public display and hated the way people just rushed in and out of the corpse collecting room so emotionlessly. I feel it could offend the sentiments of the kith & kin of those who died in the cellular jail. More",Apr-14
History of Indian Freedom Struggle,343pankajj,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,15-May-14,"As you go through the memorial, one can truly feel the pain Indian freedom fighters went through to secure independence for us.

We took a guide and his stories added to the awe and fear that this place held to Indians back then. The memorabilia is very well maintained. The light and sound show is a must-watch.

Beach Holiday? This is the Place,Narendra C,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,11-May-14,"In case you want to enjoy a beach holiday, this is the place to be. There is so much to see. Some advice 
1. Don't miss Havelock Island (Two days is ok) go in the morning and get back by the next evening. Have your tickets IN ADVANCE. 
2. See the balance of Port Blair after getting back from Havelock. I know of some friends who got stuck on Havelock and then missed their flights from Port Blair. 
3. Ross Island, Cellular Jail, Chhattam saw Mills, Museum, Ross Island are all in close proximity of each other and are possible in a day. 
4. Niel Island is also good and so is Chiriya Taapoo but them you have to spend time for these. 
5. Try your hand on snorkling. If you can spend anout 9000/- scuba diving is worth. In case you are a family of three/ four it wont be a bad idea to buy a snorkling set of your own. 
6. If you have a full day and can hire a taxi (If I remember correctly Rs 2000) go to see the sandstone caves. More",Dec-13

Moving experience,Voyager_Nineteen71,"Pune, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,04-May-14,"A visit to Andamans for me meant a visit first to the Cellular Jail. We went to see the complex as soon as we arrived in Port Blair. It was a very good experience and a reminder that freedom had its own price with lives of a lot of famous as well as unsung heroes. Complex was clean and all the 3 wings of the 7 winged jail were kept well. Had a look at the cells of those on death row, other cells, Veer Savarkar's one too... 
The light and sound show was extremely good and it helped that people sitting besides us were quiet during the show so that we could hear the sound clearly. 
The jail is not a place for young children who might be sensitive to sadness. 

Sad part of the jail visit was the ticketing experience. After we finished the jail tour, we tried to get tickets of the evening show (which is about an hour later), but were told that once the counter opened, tickets would be available only for the show of NEXT DAY evening. We were lucky that there were still a few unsold tickets, else would have to come back to the jail complex again the next day. 

Hence, it is preferable to buy both the jail, and light and sound show tickets together for the same day. More",Mar-14

Standing on the terrace, for sometime just forget the city which is now set up, imagine how cruel its for mankind to be left alone thousands of kms away from families with no hope to see them again, with no way to escape, wherever your eyes will wander its water all around. There was no arrangement of lights in the jail. The prisoners used to get light only during daytime. I am sharing some pics of evening at jail as well. And its not too late then, it was around 6pm. Because in Andaman sun sets too early. I was imagining how deadly dark it must have been for the prisoners during night. So i suggest to visit this place maybe as a small tribute to our Heroes. 

Also the light and sound show is a must watch. More",Apr-13

However, some people still afford the audacity of mocking the struggle on display, which positions their very insensitive. 

The jail also shows a light and sound show about life in the jail and its history, which is quite an attraction in Port Blair, and people throng to see this.

There are English shows on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and Hindi shows on all week days. The memorial entry fee is nominal. Separate tickets for the Light & sound show. 
Even though the museum hosts an inventory of pictures of freedom fighters housed in this jail, it is not a complete inventory. It would be good if the authorities put in efforts to make it complete.

A part of the Indian History,GairikM,"Midnapore, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-Oct-13,"The Cellular jail also known as kaala paani was a colonial prison of the British empire and was used especially to exile political prisoners to the remote archipelago of the Andamans. 
Many notable dissidents such as Batukeshwar Dutt and Veer Savarkar, among others, were imprisoned here during the struggle for India's independence. Today, the complex serves as a national memorial monument. 
The original structure had 7 wings in the form a spoke of a wheel. But during the Japanese reign a few of its wings were destroyed and in 1963 two more wings were destroyed to make place for a 500 bedded GV Panth hospital. 
However, this led to protests from several former prisoners and political leaders who saw it as a way of erasing the tangible evidence of their persecution. The remaining three wings and the central tower were therefore converted into a National Memorial in 1969. More",Oct-13

During colonial rule, construction of this jail was done by the then British government to give severe punishment to those who raised voice for Indian Independence. Far away from the main land of India, situated in the depth of the Bay of Bengal, the freedom fighter would feel utter loneliness in their single cells. In addition, the got inhuman treatment. Patriots like Veer Damodar Savarkar were kept in this prison for more than 11 yrs. Each cell has a dimension of 13.5x7.5 ft.with a single window at a height of 9 ft. The jail originally had a spoke like structure having seven blocks joining at one place with a high minar which was used as the control tower. Front of one block looks at the back of the other block, thus depriving the prisoners of a single sight of a single man.

Cellular Jail in fact was a synonym of terrible death for the true sons of mother India. During colonial rule, construction of this jail was done by the then British government to give severe punishment to those who raised voice for Indian Independence. Far away from the main land of India, situated in the depth of the Bay of Bengal, the freedom fighter would feel utter loneliness in their single cells. In addition, the got inhuman treatment. Patriots like Veer Damodar Savarkar were kept in this prison for more than 11 yrs. Each cell has a dimension of 13.5x7.5 ft.with a single window at a height of 9 ft. The jail originally had a spoke like structure having seven blocks joining at one place with a high minar which was used as the control tower. Front of one block looks at the back of the other block, thus depriving the prisoners of a single sight of a single man. 
The cellular jail is now a national museum and open for tourists, Every evening except Mondays you can enjoy a light &sound show which presents very living picture of the British days of cellular jail.

This is where the freedom fighters of India incarcerated during their ""Kala Paani"" sentence. When you see and listen to the condition in which these brave men lived on the island you will have tears in your eyes. 
To salute these selfless soldiers who actually endured unmentionable hardship to bring freedom to India, all Indians should visit Cellular Jail at least once during their lifetime. Incidentally, around 80% of the prisoners incarcerated here were from undivided Bengal.

Feel and experince the cost of freedom,aparnaka11,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,30-Jun-13,"A comparatively new structure by Indian standards, around 100 years. The structure is really well maintained, kudos to the authorities. 
The cells were so built by the British so that prisoners could never see each other. From each cell the prisoners could only see the back wall of another cell block. The Escape was impossible with only miles and miles of water all around. The gallows were kept close to the cells. Cells are small with no way to look at the outside world, except a small ventilator at the top for light. The punishment dished out to prisoners barbaric. The solitude may have moved lesser men to just end their lives. 
The light and sound show is also very moving and a must watch. If you are a patriot you will be moved to tears as narration is very graphic on atrocities committed by the British. It can get a little annoying as uncles and aunties are chatting over their phones and howling kids are left unattended. Wish there was some patrolling to throw out such people.

This is one of the most signifance features of Indian colonial history,OceanWanderer,Brisbane,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-May-13,"This unique jail, originally constructed with seven ""spokes"" each holding 3 floors of individual cells in which the occupants could only see out to blank walls was built by the British to house dissidents in extremely inhumane conditions. As well as the solitary confinement prisoners were forced to work on treadmills to produce impossible outputs and hanging was common. The jail now forms the central symbol of the Indian national flag. The spoke were uneven in position and length to suit the topography and only three now remain, the rest having been demolished to make way for a hospital. 

Although the presentation may be criticised it is an atmospheric place and a poignant reminder of the worst excesses of British colonial rule. Many of those who died are now national heroes.

Governmental Apathy,Vanderlooster,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,18-May-13,"For a national monument of such importance, I was really let down by the governmental apathy. Photographs getting damaged, walls cracking etc etc. 

The Light & Sound Show was totally marred by the sound of some helicopter that hovered above at least 6 times for a duration of 2 minutes each. This is avoidable - but is the government interested?? 

And my fellow countrymen who are yet to understand the difference between literacy and education: Patriotism does not mean signing our names on national monuments and pictures of national leaders. Actually, Patriotism is more about how much we can avoid these ""uncivilized"" instincts. Writing a few foul lines about the British only goes to prove that perhaps a majority of this country still needs to learn how to respect their freedom !! ... and the Government sleeps through it all. 

What could have been made one of India's best heritage sites, remains below average. One should definitely visit this and experience how costly our freedom was.

Victorian Jail on a Tropical Island,NeilG96,"London, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,14-May-13,"An eccentricly presented monument to the horrors of colonial rule. This Victorian Prison situated in Port Blair tells the story of how the British government decided to turn a penal colony into a more contained punishment centre for the insurrectionist Punjabis who were threatening revolution in the mid-late 19th century. Around a central watchtower and on three floors long rows of cells are arranged on likes the spokes of a wheel. The central tower now serves as a memorial to the Indians who were imprisoned here where their names can be found. You can also enter the cells and operate some of the cell bolts if you'd like to be locked up. There's a rather ramshackle exhibition with waxworks demonstrating the favoured torture techniques of the day but much, much more chillingly you can visit the room in which men were hung and observe the traps from above and below.

The tour itself is pretty short (around 45 mins to an hour). I was disappointed by the guides... they sure were very knowledgeable, but they narrated everything in a matter of fact way. I was comparing this to the tour of the Tower of London where the beef eaters narrate facts by spinning amazing tales of the days gone by.

On the second floor, at the end is Veer Savarkar's cell. Prisoners to be hanged were passed through this cell to scarify him. Through the stair we reached at the Watch tower, which is centrally situated .There is model of original seven winged jail in the center. From the top you can watch the panoramic view of sea, Ross Island and other North bay Islands. There is a hospital on the backside, built on the destroyed wings of this Jail. 
SOUND AND LIGHT SHOW- It starts at 6 Pm in Hindi and at 7.15PM in English This hair raising event, evokes the feeling of patriotism amongst the audience. It depicts the way prisoners were tortured. They never gave up and willingly, undergone all the sufferings, boldly. Technically this show is not very good but serves its purpose well. 
TIPS-you should set aside one full day to visit this jail. During day time you can take a walk around it, but must have a Guide, who can tell every detail of the different part of this jail. Arrange for your own tickets of Sound and Light show and conveyance beforehand as you will find great crowd and it becomes difficult to get taxi after show ends.

So we had the best seats in the house. The S&L show gets boring after a point. The narrative could have been better. It's good for a photo op at night, but thats about it.

I am really feeling proud of being an INDIAN. 
The inhumane treatment given by the britishers and the japanese cannot be put in words. Our freedom fighters worked under terrible conditions in scorching weather for 10 years and we were unable to stand there for even 10 minutes. 
You can also see Ross island from the watch tower which was britishers penal settlement.

Remember the Hindi show is before the English one and gets full very fast. 
No prizes for guessing its the story of the prizon and the atrocities meted out to the prisoners. Don't follow the 1000 Bengali tourists and clamour for the seats in front. The ones at the rear left have a better view and the sound is better too. Plus you are closest to the protagnist, a tree which stands on the left of the viewing gallery. The show will fill you up with a sense of pathos and pride about what that place was in the ear of the Raj. You need 2 stiff drinks afterwards to restore your sense of the present!!!

The structural specialty of the Cellular Jail is that the whole jail consists of cells. Each cell was meant for one inmate only and hence the name. Cellular Jail originally had seven, three storeyed wings with a total of 698 cells, radiating from a central tower which had an additional storey to facilitate watch and ward.Built over twelve years from 1896 to 1908 and home to hundreds of freedom fighters whose names are now engraved on the walls of its watch tower, the Cellular Jail stands as a symbol of colonial oppression, cruelty and untold suffering.

Brief about Andaman & Nicobar Islands:: 
The Andamans are a chain of 184 odd islands in the Andaman Sea at approx 1100 Kms to the south of Kolkata (takes approx 3 hours by Flight).

It became part of the Indian union in 1950 and was declared a union territory on 1956 
Histry of Cellular Jail: 
The Andamans reminds us of those freedom fighters who on 10th May 1857, gave the clarion call to rise against the British rule. This was our First War of Independence, known as Sepoy Mutiny. 
Most of them were killed by British instantly,who survived, were exiled for life to the Andamans so that their connection with their families and their country would be severed and their countrymen would forget them forever. For this reason, in January 1858, the British reoccupied Port Blair, Andamans. For the first time on 10th March 1858, J.B. Walker arrived with a batch of 200 freedom fighters. The second batch of 733 freedom fighter prisoners arrived in April 1868 from Karachi. They had been sentenced for life imprisonment. After this however it is not known how many thousands of freedom fighters were sent to the Andamans from the harbours of Bombay, Kolkata and Madras. Their numbers, names and addresses are not known. 
Although the prison complex itself was constructed between 1896 and 1906, the British had been using the Andaman islands as a prison since the days in the immediate aftermath of the 1857 War of Independence.. 
Architecture:: 
The construction of the prison started in 1896 and was completed in 1906. The original building was a puce-colored brick building. The bricks used to build the building were brought from Burma. 
The building had seven wings, at the centre of which a tower served as the intersection and was used by guards to keep watch on the inmates. The wings radiated from the tower in straight lines, much like the spokes of a bicycle wheel. A large bell was kept in the tower to raise the alarm in any eventuality. 
One of the seven wings had three stories upon completion. There were no dormitories and a total of 693 cells. Each cell was 4.5 metres x 2.7 metres or 13.5x7.5 feet in size with a ventilator located at a height of three meters. 
The name, ""cellular jail"", derived from the solitary cells which prevented any prisoner from communicating with any other. Also, the spokes were so designed such that the face of a cell in a spoke saw the back of cells in another spoke. This way, communication between prisoners was impossible. They were all in solitary confinement. 
Two out of the seven wings of the Jail were demolished during the Japanese regime. 
Post Independence:: 
Another two wings of the jail were demolished after India achieved independence. However, this led to protests from several former prisoners and political leaders who saw it as a way of erasing the tangible evidence of their persecution. The remaining three wings and the central tower were therefore converted into a National Memorial in 1969.The Govind Ballabh Pant Hospital was set up in the premises of the Cellular Jail in 1963. It is now a 500-bed hospital with about 40 doctors serving the local population. 
Now:: 
Cellular Jail contains 7 regions contain 283 separate cells with a tower in middle region and it is 4 floors building with first three for cells and the fourth floor functioned as the watch tower. One can see here the execution room where the freedom fighters were hanged. Now, the museum having lots of important witnesses, the light and sound show is a must see for travelers depicting the sacrifice of freedom fighters and also showing up the brutal history of Kala Pani. 
Freedom Fighter's in Cellular Jail:: 
Some of the better known political prisoners incarcerated in the Cellular Jail were Barindra Kumar Ghosh, Upendra Nath Banerjee, Hem Chandra Das, Ullaskar Dutta, Indubushan Roy, Bibhuti Bushan Sarkar, Hrishikesh Kanjilal, Sudhin Kumar Sarkar, Abinash Chandra Bhattacharji & Birendra Chandra Sen. All these prisoners were sent to the Cellular Jail after 1910 on their conviction for participation in the Manictollah Conspiracy case. Vir Vinayak Damodar Savarkar was sent to Andamans on 4th July 1911 with sentence of two transportations for life. When he came to the Cellular Jail his elder brother, Ganesh Savarkar was already there. But the Savarkar brothers came to know about this fact only after having been in Jail over a year.

To feel part of history and to see the difficulties our elders underwent, was something that cannot be put in words. The oil mill used to punish the prisoners, the gallows, the size of the cells, the security arrangement, etc are details that one has to see in person.

While I really salute the martyrs of indian freedom movement, i find Cellular Jail to be more hyped because of various factors such as its importance in that era, its location and the purpose for which it was commissioned. If you look at it more objectively, every freedom fighter in every jail in India had faced similar tortures. So how does that make Cellular Jail more important than the others? And how will our feelings change for someone who was held in Cellular Jail or someone who was held captive in some other jail? Sometimes structures can leave you spell bound. Like say the Taj Mahal. But again in the case of Cellular Jail, only 3 of the seven branches are standing and we are allowed in only one of them. And once you get onto the central watch tower, what you see is a modern day city with its houses and shops. It beats the enigma of the struture and the history. But one thing that stands out is the way the structure was planned. No two persons in the cells could see one another as long as they were in their confinement. And that there was no escape route from that place. May be that makes it special. For someone who would have read about the indian freedom struggle in detail,...

For someone who would have read about the indian freedom struggle in detail, Kalapani in particular, the light and sound show doesnt inspire much. One, it is too short and two, it does not catch the essence of the freedom movement. It showcases the pains that the martyrs must have gone through but it does not bring out the pride or love they must have felt for their motherland while enduring all that happily. Afterall the freedom struggle was all about giving oneself up for a common cause. 

But all said and done, its like going to Agra and not visiting the Taj, if you dont go to Cellular Jail when you are in Port Blair. Its a must see...If not anything else it will bring a sense of pride and humility to every Indian as he/she stands in a place where history was written. More",Apr-12

A national memorial to freedom fighters,sapnakapoor,India,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,23-Feb-12,"The name, ""cellular jail"", derived from the solitary cells which prevented any prisoner from communicating with any other. 
The Cellular Jail is one of the darkest chapters in the history of India's freedom struggle. 
The prison complex was constructed between 1896 and 1906, the British used the Andaman islands as a prison. The building had seven wings, each of the seven wings had three stories upon completion. There were no dormitories and a total of 693 cells. There are only 3 blocks exist and other blocks were destroyed during natural calamities. Indian govt had built hospital and couple of other buildings there. Only one block is open for public. Their are different items and pictures on display showing the history and how British warden tortured the Indian freedom fighters. There are two small museums (One on left and one on right) as you enter from the main gate of jail. There is one Neta ji museum and art gallery on first floor. There is one more art gallery in the shed between two prison builds. The names of different prisons from different parts of India are engraved on walls just under the watch tower on first floor. 
The view from roof of prison and watch tower is awesome. 
Every evening there is light and sound show.

Down the Memory Lane,sanjivmulye,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,28-Sep-11,"I had been reading a lot about Andaman Cellular Jail especially when reading history books of British Raj period. Veer Savarkar and his brother Shri Babarao Savarkar and several other freedom fighters were jailed there during British rule. During his time in the Jail, Veer Savarkar wrote poetry which reminds us of Lokmanya Tilak who wrote a great book on Bhagwad Geeta in Mandalay Jail. The freedom fighters had to do physically laborious job of extreme nature. Britishers, who are known for their love for democracy, justice and equality, treated freedom fighters like Savarkar (who was Barrister) like a robbers or hardened criminal which was totally unjust. 

All these memories rush back to you, the moment you enter the main gates of the Cellular jail. The design, architecture, the cells etc. is so daunting even today, I wonder how the prisoners/freedom fighters used to feel when they step in. Only death could take them out. It was like today's ""Guantanamo Bay"" run by British rulers then. 

The light and sound show is marvelous. One is found coming out with moist eyes and heavy heart and a feeling that we enjoy the freedom and prosperity as a citizen of India today is really the results of what they suffered then. More",Oct-10

a must visit for every true Indian- but not accurate depiction of facts,DeepMp,MP,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,10-May-10,"This is indeed one of the best places to visit in Port Blair. The light and sound show tries to take one back into the days of yore. However, there are some things in the commentary that seem wrong- 1- they say Netaji visited the jail in 1943 but the Japanese did not take him to those areas where the torture chambers were. How can this be true?? Why, Netaji hoisted the Indian flag there!! It also says that the Japanese committed great atrocities on the public of Andamans while in power there. How can this be true when actually the Azad Hind Fauj had taken up the reins of Govt in 1944. Looks like another ploy of the Nehru- Gandhi family to distort history in our eyes and make Netaji look like a fool. 2- No propoer mention of Veer Savarkar except a few lines probably added as an afterthought. 3- The horrors of the atrocities brought out by the British are clearly not brought out properly. Why one wonders. But then when you see a paper cutting which says that ""India will always remain friends with the British after Independence (by Nehru), you realise what this all is. More fools we Indians, for lapping up Nehruvian history as the ""correct"" version!! Shouldn't someone correct this? More",
They made history borin...!!!,SapnaJ,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,07-Apr-10,"I was on my honeymoon at Port Blair & frankly this is not one of the things to do when on your honeymoon. Don’t get me wrong, as much as I respect the freedom fighters of India, as much as I despise the Britishers for their wrongs to the captive in the Jail, I did not enjoy the place or the light & sound show. They made History sound boring and the show was quite less than ordinary. May be some improvements with the ambience & a decent museum will make it little interesting. Else try n avoid it….",
Historic Place for Every Indians,mammutty,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,23-Aug-09,"Andaman Nicobar Islands which lies 2 hours flight from Chennai is a must see attraction for every true Indians. Andaman Nicobar has total 572 islands of which 30 of them are accessible by tourist. Visit to Nicobar Island is restricted even for the Andaman people because of sensitivity to local tribes living there. The Cellular jail is the major attraction in Andaman Island situated in the capital Port Blair. The jail was constructed and completed over a period of 10 years from 1896 to 1906. We made our trip during 3 rd quarter of August to visit this historic place. The weather condition during August is good with little or no rain. We hired a Bengali guide (born and bought up in Port Blair) who explained in detail, what conditions our freedom fighters were kept in these jails (cells) by British Forces before we got independences. It is astonishing to know that the engineers of this jail made this jail a (very) high security prison during those times itself (100 years ago). Any prisoner who managed to escape through this security would not have survived because all four sides of this Island are covered by Sea. In total of 7 wings of this jail, though 4 of them were bombed and completely destroyed by Japanese Imperial air force during Second World War (1943), it still has 3 wings intact for us to see and experience the horrific memories of this...

You will also see 2 Museums inside this complex which has some rare photographs of those years. 

The light and sound show held every day at 5.30pm in the cellular jail will outline a chronology of events in the cellular jail till independence. After visiting this historic place, I am sure every true Indian will realise how much struggles and tribulation our freedom fighters took for us to taste the freedom what we have now.

A very ordinary Sound and Light Show,snandi,Calcutta,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,23-Jul-05,"I had been to Cellular Jail to watch the Sound and Light Show last December (2004). Frankly it was a disappointment. The narration in Hindi was boring - the light effects ordinary - and the sound crackled. The place, however, is well maintained. Makes you sad when you think of those who spent their lives in the small rooms.",

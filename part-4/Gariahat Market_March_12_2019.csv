Market that exists in Multiple Time Eras Simultaneously,sumitkasera,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,11-Feb-19,"My very early childhood in late seventies and eighties was spent in a house very close to Gariahat. The place was famous for shops on both sides of the foot path including a market that existed right in the middle of the road. So when my nostalgic visit to Kolkata took me to the place about 30 years later, the place now existed in multiple time eras simultaneously. There were modern show rooms of Samsonite and VIP selling luggage worth 10,000 or 20,000 a piece. And when we brought some Bindi (decorative items for the women’s forehead) strips from a roadside shop that totalled about 700Rs, the man selling was jumping in joy – it was possibly his biggest single transaction sale till date. For us, it was getting stuff which was possibly 30-50% cheaper than ones found in Delhi. That was Gariahat market for you – a place that stood still –we saw blouse stitching centres as we had left about 30 years ago. Same old book shops selling second hand books in the world of Amazon prime – the Punjabi stores selling Pyjama & Kurtas – the road side tea stalls and plethora of knick knacks (e.g. buttons for kurta).

My very early childhood in late seventies and eighties was spent in a house very close to Gariahat. The place was famous for shops on both sides of the foot path including a market that existed right in the middle of the road. So when my nostalgic visit to Kolkata took me to the place about 30 years later, the place now existed in multiple time eras simultaneously. There were modern show rooms of Samsonite and VIP selling luggage worth 10,000 or 20,000 a piece. And when we brought some Bindi (decorative items for the women’s forehead) strips from a roadside shop that totalled about 700Rs, the man selling was jumping in joy – it was possibly his biggest single transaction sale till date. For us, it was getting stuff which was possibly 30-50% cheaper than ones found in Delhi. 

That was Gariahat market for you – a place that stood still –we saw blouse stitching centres as we had left about 30 years ago. Same old book shops selling second hand books in the world of Amazon prime – the Punjabi stores selling Pyjama & Kurtas – the road side tea stalls and plethora of knick knacks (e.g. buttons for kurta). So many things were untouched by time. The road side shops of Gariahat market had remained – but one market where I used to go to buy stationary had been subsumed by traffic and the Gariahat flyover had been built after demolishing it. 

Then there was that customary puchka wala whose mashed potato filling along with red chana was far ahead of the chopped potatoes of Delhi – the first gulp of the puchkas of the Gariahat streets made the money spent in travel worth it. Then there was that Gughni – a local delicacy along with Aloo dum to Gulp. 

It was customary that money change was seldom available from shop keepers as they kept hunting for their bouni (first sale). The foot paths though fairly wide were largely encroached by the street shops. And the political regime did not allow any change in order. City dwellers with little ambition and aggression were possibly more content than their richer counterparts in Delhi and Mumbai. 

Go to Gariahat market for the eclectic collection of stuff – food, footwear, cosmetics & clothes– cheap and possibly useful – thrown amidst a tinge of high priced modern gadgets and consumables. More",Jan-19

Heart of South Calcutta,Doyel K,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,17-Feb-15,"This is the lifeline of post independence Kolkata.

If you are looking for madness,dhihaz,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,13-Dec-14,"Gariahat market never ceases to amaze us for its popularity amongst Calcuttans.The footpaths are full of unauthorized hawkers who behave as if they own the place(which probably they do after a Govt. move in the past to evict them resulted in a riot).You just can not walk on the sidewalks because of the shacks of hawkers.The market is great for people looking for bargain in clothes.There are a few jewelley stores too besides Pantaloon,Westside and Spencers.The vegetable and fish market has better choice and cleaner than the one in Beckbagan.Be careful driving around here as the pedestrian can go bonkers.A definite destinations for Calcuttans before Pujas.On my part it is avoidable but for the fishes.

Great Place to Shop!,ASarkarM,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,13-Nov-14,"There is no better place in Kolkata for shopping than Gariahat. This area is packed with stores on both sides of all the roads. What's even better are the hundreds of stalls on the streets. You'll find just about everything in Gariahat. Buy clothes, utensils, jewellery, shoes, bags, tablecloths, etc. The little street shops are packed with goodies, and most of these are sold at really low rates. Go with ample time in hand, and keep a cool head. Try out multiple shops before buying an item. And definitely do try to bargain! I'm not good at it. However, if you are, you'll get things for extremely low prices. The stuff that I have bought from the street sides stores have never let me down. They are durable and sturdy. 

If you want to shop in Kolkata, you must visit Gariahat! Also, it is safe for solo woman travellers. More",Oct-14

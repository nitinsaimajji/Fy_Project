"Educational institutions, vernacular books, mouth-watering foods, narrow lanes and a foolhardy adherence to the past",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,21-May-18,"This is where creme of Calcutta's old educational institutions are, but the area is neither clean nor serene - expect a huge crowd, loud buzz and plethora of juvenile and eyesore political posters all around. 
The place has quite a few good eateries, food is yummy, services are at best indifferent. 
This is the hub of books - Bengali fiction as well text books from nursery to niche post-graduate courses. yet very very few accept any modern payment method of credit cards or mobile payments. Fewer of the vernacular publishers have actually invested in modern digital technologies. 
The lanes are narrow, water-logging stories have become folklore, traders and customers would often bargain for amounts that definitely would surprise visitors from other cities. But, so would be the prices of stationary bought in bulk volumes. 
Welcome to the contradiction, where people are desperate to hold back to the past, not necessarily all of which are good and beneficial. More",Mar-18

My next favourite destinations here are the Park Hotel, Flurys Tea Room and the Chinese Restaurant, Marco Polo. I have visited Park Street on innumerable occasion and the best moment I like is the New Year Eve. There may be issues about car parking, there may be isses about overcrowding, but the moment of ushering in a New Year, when everyone comes out and greets each other, even the unknown, is a moment to cherish for a long time.

The side roads like Short Street, Camac Street, Middleton Row, Russel Street, Free School Street all have their own attractions.

The street can be crowded with broken pavements and panhandlers, but it has a unique vibe. This is where Kolkatans congregate for rum balls (Flurys), chicken chipolata (Mocambo), sweet and sour prawns (Bar-B-Q) and chelo kebab (Peter Cat). Listen to live music at Trinca's (where Usha Uthup once sang), drop into Oxford Book Store and try the double chicken roll at Karnani Mansion. If you have children with you, the book store has a separate wing for children's books plus there's a McDonald's nearby. Good to visit around the year, but at Christmas, Park Street turns magical.

For last 15 years or so Park Street is being decorated with varieties of lights from Chistmas tonew year. On 25th December, 1st January and the sunday in between Park Street becomes car-free zone. One has to walk if he or she wants to see the lights or dine. Most of the restaurants and discotheque stay opened till dawn. Nowadays it's even a very tough task to walk in Park Street after 7 pm on 25th December due to the massive crowd. I suggest one should visit Park Street on a weekday aprt from 25/12, 01/01, Saturday and Sunday. And if anyone wants to dine there during the last week of December an early reservation will be very helpful.

The understanding was that Park Street was the main shopping street of Kolkata and a good central point from which to explore the city. 

It is a good central point, but do not expect as I may have to have close to a western shopping experience. 

There are bars here, and restaurants and shops too, but if you are from any major western city you may be surprised at the state of the pavement. Yes it has a pavement unlike most of the rest of India but it is in a terrible state with most of it dug up and in a state of constant repair. Pavers give way to sand mounds, paver stepping stones and deep trenches. On a busy day, navigation in anything other than proper shoes can be treacherous. More",Dec-16

There is a few luxury hotels and some of the best and most expensive places of night live in the city (this doesn't mean they are good). This is also an old business district, with several offices and government buildings with a characteristic colonial style, but musty and rotten as the rest of the city. 

Unlike the rest of the city, sidewalks are practicable in most of the street, so there is plenty of space for beggars pesting both tourists and locals. 

If you go to Park Street in the night you will find it full of poor people sleeping in the ground, even little child's covered with plastics, so you will understand how awful Kolkata is.

We ventured in on Park Street on Sunday Night for the first time and then almost everyday for the rest of the week. Was interesting to find a queue of loyal customers standing in front of Mocambo on Sunday night, They preferred to sweat in the sweltering humidity than try any other place. 
That place gives a glimpse of how Kolkata has a mix of intelligentsia, anglophiles and the quintessential Bengali Babu. Eating in a Kolkata restaurant is not just food , 
but also the chatter of all othere present in the Dining room, yes the hum is louder than most cities,but kind of blends with the settings and is much unobtrusive. 

Park street, has beautifule art deco buildings, Many modern steel -glass concrete buildings, and many old buildings from 1940s revamped to accommodate the modern living. 

I found myself wondering how it must have been to live here in the 40s in the relaxed times. Today Park street is a noisy place, Flurry's is full of hustle bustle.Marco Polo stares in quiet elegance, and there is a hum of so many eateries and shopping places with the ever increasing traffic and foot fall.

To North Americans, do not waste your time. Absolutely nothing worth seeing, except seeing how far kaos can go. Regarding the chopping opportunities that many reviewers talk about, they might right if you are looking for the things you could find in one-dollar stores in North America or for Indian clothes that I cannot assess the value. 

We eat in a restaurant. The food was ok and the service as well.

Most well known street of Kolkata,Shourjendra D,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,1-Jul-15,"Nowadays this is called Mother Teresa Sarani, but any amount of name changing can't change history or for that matter the future. 
Park street is inarguably the most well known street of Kolkata. For years together all the restaurants,the bars and the most happening place in Kolkata with the discos and nightclubs as well were situated here on this street. 

Going to Park street for dinner at those famous eateries like the Blue Fox or Trincas were a part of folklore.But things have changed with time.Although park street remains the happening street,many many eateries have sprung up at different parts of the city and night clubs too. But charm of park street is still very much omnipresent.See for yourselves the number of cars at well past midnight,the sheer number of cabs available in front of Park Hotel or the neon signed restaurants and night clubs on both sides of the street. 

Also do not miss during Christmas week , as Park street is decorated with multiple lights almost throughout its length and there are so many things to see. 

Parking is an issue here and try to park either in Little Russel street or the road in front of Loreto.Restaurants are lined up on both sides ranging from street food like Kusum Rolls center to pricier ones like Roxy,etc inside Park hotel.

A Fun Street,Dhruba B,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,5-Jan-15,"To me Park Street is more than just a fun destination. I had my schooling here in an excellent Christian institution in the 1950s and have an emotional attachment with the stretch of the road from the St. Xavier's College to the Chowringhee. Arguably the concept of fine dining in Kolkata emerged from here with the setting up of fine restaurants like Mocambo, Trincas, Magnolia, Flury to name only a few. Today these eateries are still thriving and evn though many true fine dining restaurants have come up in the city these Park Street hangouts still draw a large crowd and one can find a long crowd of hungry diners waiting endlessly to get a seat inside even during weekday evenings. With many more restaurants added to the list Park Street is atill the city's No. 1 eating out zone. The place has changed a lot in the last 70 years as the tram lines have given way to the underground Metro on Chowringhee and a monstrous flyover blocks the view of the Maidan greens, the Street still retains its charm as a must visit zone for tourists visiting the city. The year end illumination during Christmas and New Year attracts a large crowd of young and old revellers like perhaps no other place in India. A must visit for the residents and visitors alike.

Park Street is a street, on this street are shops and places to eat, the ones I frequented on my first night were Pizza Hut and McDonalds (I was feeling a bit dodgy). These places were entirely acceptable places to eat. The road is busy and if you are there at night and you want to catch a cab, one tip; You won't. There are plenty of taxi's but you have meet a lot of criteria apparently before a taxi driver will consider driving to your location. Also with this tip I'll add a free one, if you happen to be white and you want a taxi at night be prepared for a lot of meter related lies. 

That being said there is an incredible book shop on Park Street that has very good pricing compared to what I am used to. An interesting street to walk along and worth checking out if you feel the need for some comfort food or a good book to read. More",Nov-14

In the last 2/3 years at Christmas there is a Park Street festival with live music at Allen Park on Park street and homemade food being sold on the foot paths which draws large crowds. Many Many years ago all shops had beautiful Christmas decorations but many of these establishments like Bombay Photo Stores which I remember with a large sleigh in front of it, Blue Fox restaurant which had the likes of the famous Pam Crain and Skyroom the most delectable continental food. 

Park Street also had the famous bookstore Oxford Bookstore which is worth a visit . You can browse the books and have tea at the Chai Bar.

The back streets and alleys are where it's all at and the local bazaars (rather than New Market) but they can be hard work and after an afternoon exploring you may find the need to come back to something more familiar and reassuring just to get your mind back to its comfort zone for a while.

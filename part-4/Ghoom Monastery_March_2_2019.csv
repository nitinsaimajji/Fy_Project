Amazing despite the rude noisy crowd...,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,1-Jun-17,"I felt sad for the child-monk watching the crowd in the sanctuary as nobody was respecting any rules; people were taking pictures (while there is a sign clearly asking not to), they were speaking, they were turning anti-clockwise while you are supposed to turn only clockwise in Buddhist temple (and it is supposed to be the same in Hindu temples, so I was a bit puzzled to see so many Indian tourists doing it...). As every group goes there after watching the sunrise on Tiger hill, it is super crowded early morning, so either go there at other times or be patient to enjoy truly this beautiful monastery. If you are able to isolate your mind or to be patient enough to let the crowd go, then you can truly enjoy the place and meditate. I think my experience was enhanced by the amazing Tibetan songs they were playing during our visit. It was only a CD but it was magical and despite being a non believer I felt like staying there and meditating. Had I not been on a tour with a flight to catch in the afternoon from Bagdogra I would have stayed much longer there. Luckily we could purchase the CD in the small shop at the entrance.

Like most monasteries it has interesting paintings on its wall and a giant Buddha in the center. Great stop!! This place and the sunrise at Tiger hall are my 2 best souvenirs of my Sikkim-Darjeeling trip so far! 

The little monks sell drinks and food if you feel like having breakfast after your sunrise watching you can do it here./ More",Apr-17
A good monastery near main town,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,27-May-17,You have to take the site seeing tours to visit this. It is very near to the main town. Inside of the monastery is full of grandeur.,May-17
small temple of Budha,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,26-May-17,"Nice ambience as usual like any monastery, toy-trains passing-by can give you pleasant surprise alongwith noise & smoke, small hawkers sell items at fair price at per the darjeeling mall, a dirty tea-snacks corner inside.",May-17
Solemn time inside,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,15-May-17,"A Buddhist monastery linked to an old saint. You feel rejuvenated when you enter and pray. 

The place lacks basic amenities like toilet etc.",Apr-17
Good spot-Not a must visit at Darjeeling,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,15-May-17,"Ghoom Monastry is located en route to Tiger Hills. Hence, one need not go out of way to cover this place.",Apr-17
Ghoom Monastery,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,10-May-17,If you like Monastery's then it is a nice place the construction atmosphere was great. The main attracting part is this monastery is color full and peaceful when i reach there prayer was going on so i didn't enter inside.,Mar-17
Peaceful,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,6-May-17,"This is situated almost 10 km away from main city centre and its on the way to Darjeeling while coming from Siliguri or Gangtok. Its very peaceful, sells various items, downside is that it is not very well maintained, probably because of the weather",Jul-16
Worth a visit,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,6-May-17,"Regardless of your beliefs, this place is worth a visit. Get a guide to take you as interpretation of the murals and artifacts in the monestary helps explain much about the religion and the sect, yellow hat, who worship here. 

Photography involves a donation of R100 which is nothing major.",May-17
Very accessible,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,29-Apr-17,Not as impressive as most other monasteries. Free entry. Photography prohibited as other monasteries. Peaceful because it's not crowded..can be skipped if you are visiting rumtek or other monasteries,Apr-17
"Good monastery, but nothing out of the ordinary",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,27-Apr-17,"It's quite a small monastery, not one of the more memorable ones I've visited. It is peaceful. There are numerous vendors along the way down selling cheap shawls and trinkets. The friend (a local) who took us there seemed to think that was one of the prime attractions, which I thought was strange as there was nothing special to buy. 

Actually, the Guru Sakya Monastery, which is only a few hundred meters away, is much more interesting. Hardly anyone goes there because there's no parking close—at least, that's the excuse. It's no more than a five minute walk away.",Mar-17
Samll but peacful and delighted,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,27-Apr-17,A little Monastery in the town of Ghoom. I like the ambiance there. A few shops at the way to the Monastery could be worth to buy from. Overall enjoyable.,Apr-17
Peaceful,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,27-Apr-17,An interesting monastery. In a very picturesque surrounding. A small Buddhist temple with a gathering of small numbers of monks. Souvenirs glide!,Apr-17
Small but interesting,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,24-Apr-17,Only a few monks live here now but the temple is very interesting to see. Can take photos inside too providing you have paid the fee to the monk in the entrance.,Apr-17

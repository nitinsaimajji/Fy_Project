Nice day trip,wanderer2174,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,6-Mar-19,"Victoria Memorial hall was very fascinating in the pictures but when one goes to visit it, its a litte different story...!!! The monument is a nice memorial hall no doubt but the museum inside could have done much better...!!! Some pieces are so dusty and not at all maintained !!! The grounds are very nice for picnics and greenery all around. 

The thing to notice was that they issue tickets worth Rs. 30/- for the museum and Rs. 10/- is apparently covered for visiting the grounds !! but the Rs. 10/- ticket is not issued...its very funny and there was no one we could talk to about.. though the amount is not much but the number of ppl visiting this place especially on weekends is large !! I hope the appropriate authority takes note of this. 

If you have time, then pl definitely visit. More",Feb-19
Historical place,Marlis0707,"London, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,4-Mar-19,"It’s a must see in Kolkata. 
It’s a great piece of architecture in memory of queen Victoria. 
The entry fee foreigners are 500 rupees compared to 30 rupees for Indians. 
It looks amazing from the outside, inside there are lots of paintings etc, should be better maintained, looks all tidy but could be cleaned better. 
The grounds are tidy and it’s nice to stroll around. There were lots of local people enjoying their day out in the grounds. 
Would be nice if there was a cafeteria for refreshments and were you could sit and enjoy the peace of garden away from the hustle and bustle of Kolkata. I am sure it would be well attended. More",Oct-18
"Spend a Day, but take a Guide for Inside.",Pradip B,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,4-Mar-19,"The place is worth spending a whole day, The exhibits inside are maintained meticulously.

Absolutely Amazing building,982rodneyl,"Grande Prairie, Canada",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,3-Mar-19,The Victoria Memorial Hall is an outstanding piece of architecture which is worth the visit even if there was nothing else there!

It’s historic,Natalie1204,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Feb-19,"For the history buffs, it’s great. Swords and weapons and costumes of soldiers and royalty throng the place. My personal favourite is the writing desk and chair or Queen Victoria. I do feel the interiors could be better maintained though. The lawns are expansive and great for walking around.

The place is so poorly maintained!,mtamayoo,"Madrid, Spain",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,22-Feb-19,"This is a beautiful palace built as a memorial for the Empress Victoria. 

The place is so poorly maintained that some parts appear to be about to fall apart. The art collection inside needs urgently a restoration as the paintings are so dark and there is so much dust in the air. 

The price they charge to foreigners is excessive (500 INR) while locals are charged only 30. But there is a lot of people in the building at all times! I wonder where is the money from the tickets going. 

On their favor, the gardens are in a very nice state (there is a lower fee os you visit only the gardens) More",Feb-19

We enjoyed a leisurely walk around the outside of the Memorial on a week day, but made the mistake of paying to go inside on a Sunday. It was heaving inside, with families just walking past the interesting displays of the history of Calcutta/Kolkata so fast that it was very difficult for us to stop and read and absorb the information. And the heaving crowds made it very hot and humid inside. Also, it is well worth booking your entry ticket in advance, or, as we did, using you guide to buy tickets and, with her pass, get you to the front of the queues to get in, and then leave you to it...

Worth visit,Aricewang,"Shanghai, China",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,14-Feb-19,Foreigners ticket is 500 while local is 40. But it is worthwhile to visit. The hall is so imposing and well maintained.

"Looks great outside, but inside there is just a disappointment",Vainamo,Finland,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,13-Feb-19,"As the title says. From outside the Hall looks great and makes you think it would be something comparable to famous castles or cathedrals or even substitute to Taj Mahal. But when you get it, well, you immediately realize that it is just a big memorial, at most a tiny and too heavily crowded museum, nothing else. If you are Indian citizen the admission price may be acceptable, but the much higher price for foreigners, it is too much compared to what you get. So, make a favor to yourself, take a photo outside the gate and save your money to some other attraction.",Dec-18

The architecture is amazing and what the government have attempted to do with it, although honourable needs more effort. The building is in need of significant cleaning with internal exhibits requiring a major refurbishment.

The memories came flooding back as we walked towards the main entrance and through the beautiful galleries within the building. This monument is to Kolkata what the Taj Mahal is to Agra. It is beautifully built and a must see when in this city.

Priceless artefacts in dusty showcases,mita b,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,7-Jan-19,"I visited Victoria Memorial after 50 years(was there as a 11 year old) and it looked like the display cabinets hadn't been cleaned from the inside since then. A walk around the grounds revealed why- a big 'Victoria Memorial Workers Union' office. This in essence signifies everything that's wrong with Kolkata where socialism and communism is synonymous with iron clad job security and zero dedication to the job you are paid for. 
The Hall is a superb marble building and houses interesting artefacts of history both original and copies. A must see to understand the conquest of India by the British through the machinations of the East India Company. Do visit on a day which is NOT a holiday and do linger over the dusty objects on display..many are priceless. Do read the Treaty of Mir Jaffar with the East India Company (Copy of the original) (fascinating) while lamenting the total apathy and neglect.

The museum itself (on the left as you enter) is air-conditioned, making this worth a visit even on a hot day (though you might have to miss the gardens). The entry fee of Rs500 for non-Indian citizens, while high for Kolkata, is well worth it for a 1-3-hour visit and, of course, to support a good local cause. More",Aug-18

• Entry to the museum is Rs. 30 and it includes the garden 
• Tickets for the museum are available till 4:30 PM and it stays open till 6:00 PM during summers 
• Open all days of the week 

It's an amazing place for sure. The gardens are massive and divided into wings by direction i.e. Victoria Garden East wing and so on. The museum easily takes up more than 1 hour to go through at a steady pace. There's lots to see and read in the museum about the British empire and various characters and incidents across their rule in India. The focus is mainly on how it shapes Calcutta and it's history and the people involved in the events on both sides. 

The gardens are a favorite for lovers and couples across Kolkata. It surely is one of the most iconic romantic spots and also notoriously famous for makeouts and hidden nooks and corners. If you're someone who gets easily perturbed by such scenes, it is highly recommended that you do not interfere with anyone's privacy here and just go about doing your own business.

The painting exhibit is a miss-not. It is mind-blowing to imagine how such huge paintings were created centuries ago. 

The gardens are great for a stroll. Plan to visit in the early evening hours. We felt as if we were in an AC area. The breeze was so cool and pleasant. 

No photography allowed inside the memorial so request all to abide by this rule. We saw some visitors taking photos in a clandestine manner, which was a sad sight. The entrance fee of Rs 20 is worth many more!! More",May-18

Ahistoric nostalgia!,ProfBasu,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,30-Apr-18,"All British monuments in India proclaim the glory of the Empire.

The CONTEXT is never established. 

This is astonishing! Seventy years after Independence, the grounds of the Victoria Memorial, the buildings - even the ambience sit pristine, lovingly attended, attesting to the 'benign', 'civilizing', 'glorious' influence of the Raj.

I can't say, however, that it was amongst my favourite Kolkata experiences, seeming entirely divorced from the lively and colourful streets of that great city. In the end, I think that the fact that it sits in the middle of a massive, green and pleasant park is what made it worthwhile for me.The building itself was just part of the scenery, like a folly in an English garden (if a particularly large one).

Though the museum boasts of a collection of over 35000 no but proper display of the same was left much to be desired. 

While many of the other museums in the country allow photography inside but it is a strictly no no here for reasons best known to the authorities. 

Repairing of internal tombs have been done but there is a stark difference between original and the repaired one which tells a lot about the workdmanship of present day artisans.

Terribly maintained,Tahseeen,"Hyderabad, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,14-Dec-17,"I visited Victoria memorial more than two decades back and had a very beautiful memory of it. Back then it was well maintained both inside out. The garden was beautiful and the building had its own charm. The valuables (paintings, antiques, artifacts, etc.) were preserved well. 
When I compare it with my recent visit (this year on 30th of July) it was a great disappointment to see such an excellent architecture and one of the biggest tourist attraction maintained so poorly. No maintenance at all I should say. Neither the garden nor the hall has any attraction left. Most part of the hall is closed down. Dirt all over the place with corners of the walls are marked with dried streaking stains of betel leaf. It was too hot inside the building too which makes it even more difficult to appreciate the manuscripts on display. More",Jul-17

"Ancient, old, dusty but still a must see",JCKelly21,"Darwin, Australia",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,2-Dec-17,"What a place this must have been when it was built......so majestic, gleaming white marble set in 64 acres of lawns and gardens.

It’s a must on anyone’s list when coming to Kolkata but only the down floor is open. The Memorial has two wings of 3 Floors, all closed off....what a pity. The exhibition is interesting but dusty, not well lit and difficult to read. This place could be one of the highlights of Kolkata if it was cleaned and all floors reopened with the history of Kolkata exhibited........what a draw card it could be, but it’s still a must see. 

The grounds or 64 acres are lovely to wander through....just sitting in the cool of the trees watching school groups and thinking back to the old days when women in their finery promenaded it’s walks. More",Nov-17

The whole area (memorial and the gardens) is very silent, almost tranquil, except for the little traffic noise from the nearby roads. The building and the many surrounding structures (gates, pillars, etc) are grand and beautiful. The building, made mostly in white marble, still looks pristine and quite well-maintained.

I was surprised that there are a lot of pigeons inside the building to the extent that plastic sheeting has been place above the oil paintings to protect them from the bird droppings. Surely something can be done about this - a sparrowhawk would be a good investment. The display on the history of the city was fascinating but it needs some refreshing as very worn in places. 
Like so many interiors in Kolkata it could do with some tender loving care and the building is not 100 years old. I felt very sorry for two workmen who were attempting to clean a huge bronze plaque outside the building with two toothbrushes and no cleaning agent at all.

Victoria (as popularly known) is a sort of museum wherein you will see the history during the British regime in pictures and paintings and statues from the eyes of the then British rulers. The interesting point here is that you can visualise the places and culture of India during those years in pictures. 

The Victoria Memorial Hall is a huge building with statues of british queen and stalwarts of that period. The architecture is worth watching and the garden surrounding the hall is a soothing place to take rest. More",Apr-17

The Victoria Memorial, a huge monument made of white marble located in the heart of the City of Joy, Kolkata (erstwhile Calcutta) in West Bengal, India is one of the most famous monuments in West Bengal that has become a museum and popular tourist spot of the state. A brainchild of George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston and Viceroy of India, this monument epitomising beauty and elegance was dedicated to the memory of Queen Victoria (1819–1901). This grand and exquisite memorial not only stands as reminiscence to the rule of British Crown in the Indian subcontinent but also stands out as an excellent architectural gem in Indo-Saracenic revivalist style. It is a must visit tourist destination for first time visitors to experience the essence of Victorian era in the midst of the bustling metro city of Kolkata. More",May-17

Management not up to scratch,Kat T,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,28-May-17,"The marble is definitely impressive to see. But, like the big cathedrals of Europe, these monuments were not built and cannot now be remodelled to reduce the maintenance costs and to make money. That is fine. What is much more dissatisfying is the abysmal way in which this place had been opened to visitors. Seasoned travellers may recall that non-Indian visitors are charged much higher ticket prices than Indians. That doesn't entitle you to special treatment, but it does entitle you to be able to see the gardens decently operated and roam the interiors un-harassed. This place does not satisfy on both counts. One of the pictures show a shut off fountain. Now, elsewhere in India, you will also see some sights where the fountains had been shut off and left entirely dry. That is fine. But here (pictured) they have even ripped up the base exposing the cement (or is it concrete?!?). It does not look like a renovation work-in-progress. Then once you are inside there are no signs at all warning you that you cannot take photographs of the interior. In fact, people come to see the interior, and not surprisingly they may want to take a picture of the impressive (it is, in fact, very big, tall, round, in marble) dome. (See pictures, before one was told, quite arbitrarily, not to take pictures.) And then the security guards got in the way, first on the upper mezzanine... The marble is definitely impressive to see.

(See pictures, before one was told, quite arbitrarily, not to take pictures.) And then the security guards got in the way, first on the upper mezzanine saying no photos up on the mezzanine, then the ground floor guard saying no photographs at all in the interiors. That's unacceptable. Either the first guard was wrong about no photographs on the mezzanine only, or the second guard was wrong about no photographs in all the interiors. Either way, there are no signs where sorbet warning anyone that no photographs be taken. In fact, if that was the car, one would have skipped this sight and Kolkata altogether, and they can guard either an empty monument or leave it all to the domestic audience. Good riddance. 

There is also no air conditioning in the entire interior, except for a hall which had been converted to a museum. Too dark. Low ceiling. Don't on the inscriptions too small to read without leaning in close. Can also see exposed pipes and concrete ceiling. Detracts from the impressiveness of the (non-photographable) marble. 

Not recommended until management gets up to scratch. 

Traffic and drop off points also very busy. The ticket sales point is in the south but entry to interior of hall must be done from the northern door. Bring a change of clothes against the Bengali humid weather. 

The place does look impressive; it is just let down by management. And if they cannot manage it well, then the park is big enough for a mega mall redevelopment. Kolkata downtown could use a newer, fancier, brightly lit, air conditioned mega mall. More",May-17

The whole boundary has been barb-wired with a double fence. The island in front of the main entrance with Victorian sculptures is now barricaded, and the once prominent dignitary atop the centre has long been replaced by some local poet. 

The grounds itself has some construction work going on in slow motion. The arena for the light and sound show which may have been a popular attraction till a decade ago, is now a ""white elephant"", whiter than the Memorial itself. Pardon the pun! 

The inside was a huge disappointment as a major portion of the halls are closed for ""restoration"" or ""security reasons"", or whatever. Those gigantic oil paintings, the robes and uniforms, the royal furniture, the very old sketches, etc. are no longer on view. We're the exhibits destroyed in the process of restoration??

Cool British architecture in Kolkata,hockspe,"Durham, North Carolina",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,9-May-17,"This is one of the few tourist attractions in Kolkata, so with that in mind, this place was pretty cool. Prepare to spend maybe about an hour to and hour and a half here. If you are craving to see some green while in Kolkata, this is probably the place to go. The inside of the memorial was decent. The front area had a shabby art gallery of framed photos of some folks involved with Kolkata's history. The middle was a big display area with some interesting information about the leadership in India post British rule. You can also walk upstairs and see some statues an learn a little more about historical figures. The back rooms contained some more art you'd expect to find in an actual art gallery, and the pieces seemed pretty nice (I'm no art expert). The garden area was okay, but the pools of water were pretty nasty. People also didn't really seem to care about littering everywhere. 

I give it 4 stars because it's probably the nicest, non-temple place to visit in Kolkata, but it doesn't blow you away. 

One last thing - if you are of a different skin complexion than the local people, be prepared to have your picture taken, with or without your permission. I felt like a zoo animal by the end of the visit. More",Apr-17

Spectacular building and exhibits,alliharper,"Miami, Florida",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Apr-17,"While in Kolkata, my family of four visited the Victoria Memorial (the Taj Mahal of Kolkata, according to our guide). 

It is a spectacular building with a huge dome and tall entryway, centered on a large green space, well kept. There is a huge statue of Queen Victoria outside the building, looking very regal. 

Inside there are photographs, statues, and documents related to the rule of India by the British. Very interesting and well displayed. 

However, as four people among the very few Westerners in the memorial that day, we had the uncomfortable experience of having men, women, and children staring relentlessly at us up close. People followed us around, crowding us, craning their necks to see us better. During the three weeks we were in India and during a previous visit to India by my husband and me in 2013, we never had another such experience.

A good tip: bring water and snacks along as this a large area and walking around is bound to bring on the munchies :) 

One downside is that you are NOT allowed to take photos inside the museum. Not even with your mobile phone and the attendants watch you like a hawk as if you are a criminal for wanting to take some memories back. 

A silent compact digital camera is always good to have handy or even a GoPro - and work in a tag team and distract the guard whilst the other takes some shots!

The Victoria review (review on Victoria Memorial- Kolkata),Dasguptaledia,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,2-Mar-17,"Opened in 1921, the Victoria memorial is the largest marble foundation in Kolkata, West Bengal.it was built in the memory of Queen Victoria and the first foundation stone was laid in the year of 1906.The Victoria Memorial is a museum now filled up with the antiques of the then community, including war weapons dresses etc etc. 
The mean attraction to me is the garden. The vast green surrounding is a place where winter sunlight can be enjoyed . The garden is blessed with soft grass beds, beautiful huge trees densely planted at places. Small flower plantations, and other trees neatly arranged planted. couple of artificial lakes adds to the beauty of the place.The place provides a good atmosphere especially for the college goers, friends and couples. 
The winter afternoon is a bliss here. With the decrease in temperature (as per Calcutta atmosphere) the afternoons are fresh and filled with life . The compound changes the mental state and pulls you out of the metro chores . Image of the uge marble place on the lake is a thing anyone would love to see. The place sooths tye eyes and brain . 
All in all, if life needs a 'chat- break' amongst greenery and small lakes the memorial compound is the appropriate place. More",Dec-16

"A "" must see"" attraction of Kolkata",basu55,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,21-Feb-17,"One cannot visit Kolkata and not visit Victoria Memorial. It is possibly the most recognized landmark of Kolkata after Howrah .Bridge. The entrance fee for Indians is a nominal Rs 10/20 ( garden/museum), and, although it is a bit higher for ""foreigners"", I think it is worth every rupee. ( The Museum is closed for public on Mondays, I think). 
The garden around VM is beautiful and is a wonderful place to spend a lazy winter afternoon ( there are, I understand, monthly and yearly tickets for locals who wish to do their morning/evening walks on a more sustained basis). 
The Museum is, well a Museum, with a lot of beautiful paintings and a number of sculptures. Apart from the usual portraits and other paintings of British aristocracy, there are many paintings ( and a lot of information ) about the ""babu""s of Bengal. 
Covering the garden as well as the Museum well, would take you anywhere upto 2 hours, but its definitely worth the time ( as well as the entrance fee). 
The only ""negative"" is that ""Parking"" is difficult around VM, and, unless you have a driver to drive you around, it is better to take a cab or some other public transport. More",Feb-17

As the charge for Indian citizens is 10 rupees, (12.5 pence) there were literally hundreds of visitors. I am not sure that they took anything in as they just filed past every exhibit not stopping to read. It appeared as if it was just a day out for them.

The monument in white marble looks beautiful as it gets reflected in the lake in front of the monument. The Angel of Victory which stands atop the monument used to rotate in its earlier days and it is said that the flute it held in its hand used to produce beautiful music as wind passed through the flute. The museum that houses in the inner chamber of this monument boasts of a huge number of artifacts from the history.

Spacious museum with colonial architecture,Pourobi,"Montreal, Canada",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,12-Jan-17,"The memorial is a large complex with an impressive architecture but unfortunately, it hasn't been put to good use. Random works are presented throughout and some of the pieces on display have no dates or where they were acquired from. 

I was slightly disappointed by the content of the museum. I would have expected a more in-dept true history of British colonialism in India rather than glorifying their reign. Furthermore, much of the history depicted in the museum revolved around Kolkata rather than the whole of India. I understand that Kolkata at the time was the capital but it would have been equally important to display the history of colonialism throughout the country. 

The interior is quite dark and proper lighting should be used. It was difficult to see some of the pieces on display because there was much shadow on them. 

It is worth a visit if one wants to bask in its colonial architecture, otherwise, content-wise it is lacking and scattered. Not a good place to learn about the colonial nature of the British Raj. More",Dec-16

We first went on a Sunday and it was packed. Probably a good 30-45 minute wait to get the ticket. So we went back on Monday and it was empty. The only problem was that on Monday you cannot access the inside of the Museum therefore we could only pay for the Garden.

Some signage of entry, exit, route should be in place. Then we dont have need for multiple security folk blowing on shrill whistles all the time.

There is an entrance fee, more expensive for foreign travelers as usual. The gardens surrounding the memorial are spectacular. It was very busy and apparently always is. From every angle it is tempting to take photographs. Again there is security and a bag check. Historically it has masses of information on Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. There are photos and paintings and the written word is also displayed in glass cabinets. It is not possible to take photos actually inside the memorial understandably they do not want to damage the records of Queen Victoria's letters etc: Unfortunately as outside any tourist site there are very aggressive sellers of postcards and such. They will not take no for an answer and congregate at the front entrance and also the back entrance. Take care with your bags and be prepared to exit at a totally different road layout. There are many tuk-tuks available, usual problems with drivers, be clear you do not want to go to gem sales or clothing designer sales.

Surrounded by sprawling lawns the memorial is flanked by two tanks. The memorial houses a collection of artefacts of an important part in the history of India especially relevant to Calcutta — statuary, historical documents, Persian manuscripts, objets d'art and weapons. Portraits and paintings by 18th-19th century European artists who journeyed through India are of immense historical importance. The pride of the collection are landscapes by the uncle-nephew duo Thomas and William Daniell. Along the balustraded gallery within the dome, twelve lunette frescoes depict the main events in Queen Victoria’s career. In 1992 the Memorial opened the KOLKATA GALLERY that graphically chronicles the history and growth of Kolkata from 1690 to 1947. It portrays national leaders who contributed to Bengal’s renaissance and India’s independence. Unfortunately the Memorial’s invaluable collection is poorly represented in its Gift Shop.

Authentic taste of European architecture,Drashya,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,31-May-16,"The iconic Victoria Memorial is probably one of the most visited of Kolkata's attractions. The entry fee is very modest and hence the landmark is as popular amongst tourists as it is amongst locals. I visited the memorial on Sunday morning and the area was highly crowded. Although it is a beautiful example of Victorian architecture, I found way too much similarity with the palaces and museums I had seen in France and Italy and frankly wasn't very impressed by it. Although the display of paintings and other antiquities was also not very interesting. 

Upon visiting more of the city, however, I can safely say that there are much more interesting things to see in Kolkata (like the Zamindar havelis in Purono Kolkata, or the area in general) that reflect the city's character than Victoria Memorial. If you have seen colonial or Western European architecture before, and are saturated with it, I'd strongly advise you to spend time on other attractions in and around the city. More",Apr-16

As with Taj, MUST be done in both right day light and at night. 
Inside rather more of an acquired taste and a bit for history boffins. 
Unlike other sights great to see it being well cared for.

A museum houses the memorial at present with paintings depicting history of Kolkata from British India times. Museum alone is worth your time.

There is a main entry for all to go in. This place has a 'foreigner fee' which is 10 times the amount of what an Indian resident pays. If you have seen the Taj, this will not be as impressive.

It does justify the much-overused word 'iconic', but one point of interest is its role as a statement of the British Raj - yet erected by people who had no concept of how soon afterwards India would become independent. 

It is set in lovely gardens; there is a large quantity of historically interesting material contained in the building. It certainly justifies time devoted to exploring it.",Mar-16
Much ado about something,pragya007,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,24-Mar-16,"Although this is what outsiders often remember Kolkata for, on my second visit to the Victoria Memorial Hall (who knew it's closed on a Monday, not even Kolkata resident did!) and somehow on my trip, everything was under renovation (making the photographs look not so good) including the Victoria. One good thing is I used Victoria to guide all my cognitive maps, this is one icon everyone in Kolkata knows. 

I won't deny it's a massive structure and a beautiful one at that. The ongoing painting exhibition as well as that of Japan was good. However, the Kolkata exhibition is not maintained that well with dust and cobwebs gracing the on-exhibition things. You can go up a flight of stairs to have a closer look at the ceiling and the adorned paintings. I believe perhaps my excitement was marred by the fact that I have seen so many palaces with beautiful architecture and intricate carvings that this one somehow paled in comparison. 

Nevertheless, if you are in Kolkata, you definitely should give this a visit. Also, take a walk around the periphery and the gardens. The water bodies around are not suitable enough to sit around. They seem like stagnant water full of mosquitoes, so better avoided. However, you can sit in the garden for sometime and look around. You can see the St Pauls' Cathedral from here. More",Mar-16

From outside the hall looks majestic and you will be tempted to go inside. The ordeal starts while buying the ticket. You will have to stand in line for nearly 30 mins to get the Rs 20 ticket for the entry. Most of the rooms inside the hall is shut and the rooms that you can visit is dusty and dirty. The air conditioned rooms which hosts painting and books is crowded by locals who just hangs around for the AC. Cameras and not permitted inside the Hall and I learnt it the hard way. There is no notice or warning which tells you this. The park outside the hall is huge and beautiful if you can overlook the crowd who eats,spits,play and sleep.

Must visit monument,amathur2014,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,17-Mar-16,"This was my second visit to the Victoria Memorial in three years. It is a splendid monument, the ankle-twisting walk across small pebbles not withstanding, and is regal in keeping with a 19th century homage to the then Empress. It is the building, its history and the stained glass which (for me) hold more interest than the contents, although the Daniell and other paintings are well worth more than a casual look. But the piece de resistance is the exhibition at the back of Calcutta (as it was then called) which details the city's growth from the days of Job Charnock through to the times of the Bengal Renaissance and its great figures. This part had me enthralled, it was done with such attention to detail, so many supporting artefacts, such well written text. I wish they would publish a catalogue! More",Feb-16

As night descends on Calcutta, the Victoria Memorial Hall is illuminated, giving it a fairy tale look. It is interesting to note that the Victoria Memorial was built without British government funds. The money required for the construction of the stately building, surrounded by beautiful gardens over 64 acres and costing more than 10 million was contributed by British Indian states and individuals who wanted favors with the British government. At the top of the Victoria Memorial is a sixteen foot tall bronze statue of victory, mounted on ball bearings. More",Feb-16

The horse drawn carts give people a joy ride. And the parks all around although significant in the colonial past, are rarely asociated any more with those.

Splendid Colonial Building but disappointing interior,RobCreview,"Douglas, Isle of Man",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,9-Feb-16,"This is a huge, magnificent building that gives you insight into the recent colonial history of India and how the colonists tried to instil a sense of grandeur. The gardens are well kept. 

The paintings and exhibits in the interior need restoration and cleaning and the descriptions could be more informative. Given how modern museums and galleries around the world with far more valuable contents are increasingly allowing non-flash photography, I felt it was disappointing that taking photos was banned in the interior. 

This was the first site that I visited in India. I was quite familiar with this type of building, living in the UK and knowing Australian and other cities with colonial architecture, and so I yearned to see something that was unique to India. More",Jan-16
Beautiful Structure Going Downhill,Milani1987,United States,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,8-Feb-16,"The price to enter for Indian Nationals is 20 INR and for foreigners it is 200 INR. This place is beautiful, but it is going downhill. One would think that with all of the money brought in by foreigners, they would invest in the cleanliness of the outside and inside. On the outside there was a large amount of trash on the ground, which is not pleasing to the eye. I know for a fact that the Queen of England would be very unhappy with how India has taken care of such a beautiful place. Now on the inside, there are a lot of artifacts that should be properly placed in a bulletproof-tempered-glass-structures.

Like there was little respect for the heirlooms of old Calcutta. On the first level there are a few security guards. The security guards are not very excited to work or guard the monument. You will see a few guards on their cell phone or reading the newspaper. So when the guard is occupied that is the perfect time to whip out your camera and take a pic. But if they catch you, IDK what will happen. No photography is allowed inside. I’m not too sure why. It’s not like there is anything of extreme value inside the monument. Even when you...

It’s not like there is anything of extreme value inside the monument. Even when you go to the Louvre, in Paris, to see the Mona Lisa, you can take as many pictures as you like. 

Furthermore, on the inside of the memorial there are containers that look like trash bins that have reddish slime coming out of the top. So the red slime is betel nut paan. ""Paan"" is something Indian people love to chew on. It gives them a bit of a high, but then they have to spit it out like chewing tobacco. So yeah, it made me sad to see that there were containers for paan inside the monument. There were signs not to drink or eat, but hey if you want to spit out your paan, go for it. The paan isn’t only in the trash bins – you will notice that it is also on the walls and doors nearest those bins, because of course people will miss the target. 

There is a second level inside the monument which gives a closer eye to the life of Queen Victoria. It’s all very interesting. On the 2nd level this is what to lookout for: 
1. Birds – they will possibly poop on you. There is a good amount of bird feces on the 2nd level. 
2. The Indian Tourists – You will be standing, reading about the monument or soaking in the beauty, then some Indian person comes and pushes you out of the way so they can stand where you are. They won’t say “pardon” or “excuse me”. It’s a cultural thing to push and shove to get what one wants. (You’ll understand the pushing once you take the bus, metro, train, or tram. 

On the outside of the memorial, on the grass, you will see many couples. Most un-married couples come here so they can hold hands and kiss in public. Remember, this is not a Western country, so the idea of kissing someone in public is too sexy for people to handle, unless you are hiding behind a tree or bush. More",Jan-16

With well laid out gardens, large water bodies in symmetrical pattern, large trees some of them more than 100 years old, lovely flowers in bloom, the memorial building looking impressive and catches attention from far. The building also houses a museum that displays some rare paintings. Unfortunately the upkeep is very bad and the display is pathetic. Large crowds add to the woes.

One of the many things that defines Calcutta,Rshukla51,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,3-Feb-16,"Over a 100 years old since its construction commenced, Victoria Memorial is the pride of Calcutta. While designed in the Indo-Saracenic style, this monument uses a mixture of British and Mughal elements as well as Venetian, Egyptian, Deccani and Islamic architectural influences. Many Indians believe it is also inspired by Taj Mahal Because of its use of white Makrana marble, its dome, octagonal chattris, terrace, and corner towers. 

The Victoria Memorial has a number of galleries with a rare collection such as the illustrated works of William Shakespeare, Omar Khayyam and Wazid Ali Shah. But the Calcutta gallery is interesting which traces the history of Calcutta until 1911, when the capital was transferred to New Delhi. The gardens over 64 acres are delightful and you can see local folks around and about in the mornings and evenings.

The Art Gallery and the matter on the History of Calcutta is quite fascinating. However it is sad that we are unable to maintain and understand the value of not littering, spitting in such spaces.

Our attraction was paintings made by Daniel brothers. They went across India during colonial period and discovered the glory of country. With their fine paintings, they captured the real picture of India and made several paintings. All these paintings are displayed in VM. Another collection that took our notice was some books written in different parts of India.

Not worth it at all,TRafa,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,15-Jan-16,"The grounds are barren, the museum was too crowded. The artefacts are not well maintained.

The stairs had spittoons at each corner, and the surrounding area of the spittoon red and stained with people spitting ""paan"" residue, not a sight you expect inside such a famous museum! 

Even if a small amount of the daily revenue is spent in restoration the place would have looked much more well kept and regal. 

There are way too many visitors who will constantly shove and push while you are trying to look at a century old writing or ivory work of the Moguls. People lack the common decency of letting respecting elderly or young children and half of them aren't even interested in the things on display.

From outside, the white marble gives a very impressive look. When I visited, one outside side of it was being renovated. 

From inside, it is impressive as well. It contains an exposition of antiques and historical artifacts. It is very crowded. 

The park has a lot of potential for being a magnificent one. However, any one with a little gardening background can notice how neglected the park is.

No shouting vendors, or touts to shove you along here...simply pay your 20R (200R for international visitors.

Early morning at the Victoria Memorial,Tarak N,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,26-Dec-15,"My Trip to Victoria Memorial was for a early morning glimpse of the Structure . And to take a few snapshot at the golden hour. 
I have jotted down all the points I can recall. 
1) There was no parking arrangement and I had to park a few kilometer away in one of the clubs situated in Maidan. I think there is some parking besides the Jawaharlal Nehru road. 
2)I took a Cab to Victoria from the parking place. 
3)Ticket was cheap Rs 10. and no charge for camera (still). 
4)Due to winter the visibility was not good but, manageable . 
5)I entered from North gate. 
6)Every thing was OK except two things 
a) Always some kind of construction is going on ,which blocks the beauty . 
b) The Path leading to the Hall is of Pebbles which is disgusting to walk on and is dusty , and there were dust all over my camera lens . 
7)Park around is good. 
8)The architecture is complex and with proper inspection can see it is not a hall but a castle and was one of the most secure place of that time. 
9)It seemed to me that the marble structure is just a camouflage for the castle behind it. 
10)I didn't enter the building as they were still closed as it was early morning. 
11)Over all a good place to visit. More",Dec-15
A Landmark,RoyCh_S,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,26-Dec-15,"When one thinks about Kolkata, two images I think two images readily comes to mind, one of Howrah Bridge (Rabindra Setu) and the other is Victoria Memorial. Though it is a colonial era building and was made to glorify British rule, presently it is an excellent museum and a lovely garden (Queen's garden). So, if you ever visit Kolkata, never forget to pay a visit to this place and be ready to be amazed by huge oil paintings and other historical relics. I would suggest that one should devote at least half of a whole day to get the feel of this place. Finally, there is a Light and Sound show during evening on Kolkata which should never be missed. Tickets for this show is generally in high demand, so it is better to book your place early. More",Dec-15

There are many paintings depicting both the British lifestyle in India and that of Indians (mostly the nobility) in British India. 
A painting by the Russian artist Vasseli Verestchagin, of the visit of Prince of Wales to Jaipur in 1876, stands out for its opulence. 
However, it is the magnificent lifesize paintings of the Daniells, Thomas and his nephew William, of life, temples, riversides and adventures of India that brings alive the sheer romance of Victoria Memorial.",Aug-15

The garden is huge, the entry fees is cheap and the memorial is massive and the architecture is awesome.

Day Excursion,shehnas a,singapore,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,21-Dec-15,"I was there on a Sunday. They are closed on Monday. It was Super crowded with families and tourists. Entry rates are as follows in the picture. Important to note is that no change is given (so pls bring exact change). 

In the hall itself -- I'd say you'd only need about 45mins to an hour. It's not a big area to see (although the building is huge). Second floor is just an area to walk in a circle. Most people are just going through the motion -- and no ones really paying attention on the second floor. Such a pity though. But other than that, there are old artefacts and paintings from the Victorian era (as in Queen Victoria). 

There is an area designated for families to have picnics/ laze around.. Beautiful ground! 

Please note: no pictures are allowed in the memorial hall. Also note, there is no parking nearby. Most people just get dropped off and picked up (as I did). There are tons of taxis though. So fret not. More",Dec-15

You must obtain your ticket outside before entering the grounds. No real queue exists so you will have to work your way toward the ticket window. The entrance price for foreign nationals was only 200 INR, quite a bargain. Security is excellent and security guards kept people moving. If you do not like crowds, you may find the hall and the grounds to be a little much.

The central dome is worth the climb as 12 murals of the life and times of Queen Victoria adorn the walls and are only visible on that level. 
The Clive gallery was for me the most interesting hall as it charted the West Bengal history from the early traders of the East India route through to partition. Also the reality of my childhood history lessons and those schoolbook passages of how wonderful Clive of India and his fellow officers were, is clearly now being called into question. 
The excesses of the wealthy traders was also quite extraordinary, do find the details of the household of four adults who in 1757 rented a house for £1200 a year and had 110 servants to look after them, it is quite revealing. 
The wealth one was able to amass was clearly tempered by the very reduced chances of being able to return home and enjoy it. Disease, disability, death and most commonly delirium accounted for many of the budding managers, civil servants and entrepreneurs who came to chance their fortune in West Bengal. Testament to this are the very young ages noted in people's epitaphs.

You can see it is made to impress, British colonial style!. The hall is situated in a lovely park with several statues. So after a nice walk you arrive at the entrance of a lovely building (under renovation while we were there). It wasn't very crowded even though we were there at a time when there was no entrance fee (international museum day). When it is a warm day then most of the building won't give you much relief... cause it is warm inside too... only one wing had AC, the rest had ventilators or nothing at all, still it is worth to see.... the building is lovely and so are the things on display, there is much to see and should not be missed as it also gives you an insight on what it was like in Kolkata and india during the colonial times. 

We loved it, unfortunately your not allowed to make pictures inside and sadly for me my batteries were finished before we arrived at the hall itself. 

Do go and see this, reserve at least two hours and if you want to relax and enjoy the park add another half an hour... really worth your time and money (for me this is one of the nicest things I've seen in India so far). More",Sep-15

"Glorious building, $$$ for foreigners. Hugely disappointing inside.",ASocial N,"Layer de la Haye, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,7-Jun-15,"Victoria Memorial Hall - Kolkata 

The cost of entry includes entry to the gardens and is massively inflated for foreign visitors. The gardens are very pleasant, and there are a few seats under the trees to relax on. Some bags are allowed inside, some aren't, the decision seems arbitrary and the security apathetic. 

The building itself is spectacular, even though when we saw it, there were renovation scaffolding works up. Inside is still spectacular, but.. 

The first gallery that you come to manages to board up this glorious building and cover over many original features. As you move into the rotunda area, - again spectacular, its gloomy with what can only be described as a bizarre mishmash of completely un connected items - from the model of a ship to books on display. There is little to no signage, what information is available is nonsensical. 

Go up the stairs and walk around the gallery, there are some details on the paintings up here, do take note of the explanations on each as they're rather interesting. 

And that's it. Back down the stairs, and out to the final area, where there wasn't anything other than a statue when we there. More",Mar-15
Worth a visit!,Hchild90,"Eugene, Oregon",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,6-Jun-15,"The most impressive aspect of the Victoria Memorial does not lie in the building itself, but rather in it's placement, along with its green sprawling lawns, in a city so classically ""Indian."" I felt a rather Taj Mahal-ian effect when I entered the grounds, leaving behind the trash-filled streets one second and strolling in beautiful gardens reminiscent of those in London the next. It must be a truly impressive sight for someone who has never seen such European things with their own eyes, since this kind of building is very commonplace in England, and yet so atypical in India.

The museum has a collection of many beautiful paintings of the Victorian era, right after the British came to India. The Victoria Memorial museum has a large collection of paintings, in watercolours and oil by European painters like Charles D'oyly, Johann Zoffany, Tilly Kettle, the Daniells, William Hadges, William Simpson and Thomas Hickey, among others. They depict scenes during the early British rule; the attached painting is an example.

Its an ugly, squat marble structure that is more an eyesore than a thing of beauty. While the Tajmahal soars and makes you catch your breath by the sheer perfection of its proportions, the Victoria Memorial squats on its haunches and spreads out most obscenely. 
Perhaps it is fitting that the Taj is a thing of supreme beauty because it is a tribute to Love, while the Victoria Memorial is ugliness in stone because it is in praise of a brutal coloniser, racist and imperialist demon. 
The marble is deteriorating fast because of Kolkata's killing pollution, the grounds are ill-maintained, the visiting crowds are ill-behaved, and getting cameras stolen is commonplace.

The memorial was constructed by generous donations from Indians whether individuals or Princes of Indian States. In those days it cost about rupees one crore. The President of Royal Institute of British Architects, William Emerson designed the building in a architectural style known as Indo-Gothic, Hindoo or Hindu-Gothic, Mughal-Gothic, Neo-Mughal or combined it is known as ""The Indo-Saracenic Revival"". The memorial proposed to have A grand building with museum and garden. It is all there in the heart oh Kolkata (British name - Calcutta).

Majestic and peaceful place to visit in the heart of Calcutta,niknakpaddywhack,london,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,26-Apr-15,"I visited this place in the 70's and loved it then....going back was not a wasted journey! It's an oasis of greenery,flowers,birds,water in the form of moats forming a crescent around the building. 
Beautifully maintained,the marble looks so white and fresh, as though it had been built yesterday. It's basically a tribute to Queen Victoria,large statue of her in front of the main building. Inside,at the time we went round an exhibition of railway stamps,more interesting than you might think! Stamps from around the world,collected over the years,also an art exhibition and collages about recycling from a variety of secondary schools. All fascinating in their own way. You can climb up to the viewing gallery to get a closer look at the paintings,which are all around the dome,depicting Victoria's life. 
Downstairs there is a well arranged history of Calcutta,right from the beginning to the present day. 
No cameras allowed inside,so just remember!!! Well worth a visit,allow a couple of hours.Take time to enjoy the gardens and breathe in the fresh air! More",Apr-15

Worth A Visit During You Trip To Kolkata,LarsOpReis,"Dordrecht, The Netherlands",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,23-Apr-15,"Victoria Memorial Hall go for a walk in the garden or relax with your beloved in the shades.... 

One of the must sees when visiting Kolkata. You can decide to only visit the garden (10ir) or also the interior (200ir for tourist) there are different galaries on display and the building it self is fantastic. 

When we visited april15 they were doing some reconstruction on the outside, but you would stil be able to take great pictures. I've added some to this location. 

Be sure to take a walk in the gardens or go for a ride in a horse carriage. 

Warning: the toilets or ""washroom"" as they call it, are a nightmare (what else is new in India) be sure to go at your hotel before you visit the Victoria Menorial Hall. ;-)

Practical tips on the Victoria memorial,CaptainBasu,Kolkata,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,3-Feb-15,"The Victoria memorial is a unique and wonderful place in the heart of Kolkata, but I am sure you have read about this fact in a lot of places. Here are some useful tips if you are not from around Kolkata: 1. Plan at leisure, if possible : Do not rush with the Victoria Memorial. Set aside a few hours of one evening for the place, it will be worth your while. I have been to several beautiful places allover the world and I can tell you first hand - it is one of the best places you will go to. 2. Avoid any local tour operators : If you are from a foreign country, In a country like India and especially in a city like Kolkata - its easier than you think to get by with English. In the Victoria Memorial you have very less chance of stumbling upon someone who does not know English. You can easily get by your way. You really do not need to pay anyone for any expensive tour operator to show you around. 3. It will cost you less than a dollar to get to any part of the city if you are willing to use Public transport like the Metro. I do not recommend other local transport for foreigners though. You will be better off taking a cab, and that too wont cost you more than a few dollars. Nowadays they all... The Victoria memorial is a unique and wonderful place in the heart of Kolkata, but I am sure you have read about this fact in a lot of places. Here are some useful tips if you are not from around Kolkata: 
1. Plan at leisure, if possible : Do not rush with the Victoria Memorial. Set aside a few hours of one evening for the place, it will be worth your while. I have been to several beautiful places allover the world and I can tell you first hand - it is one of the best places you will go to. 
2. Avoid any local tour operators : If you are from a foreign country, In a country like India and especially in a city like Kolkata - its easier than you think to get by with English. In the Victoria Memorial you have very less chance of stumbling upon someone who does not know English. You can easily get by your way. You really do not need to pay anyone for any expensive tour operator to show you around. 
3. It will cost you less than a dollar to get to any part of the city if you are willing to use Public transport like the Metro. I do not recommend other local transport for foreigners though. You will be better off taking a cab, and that too wont cost you more than a few dollars. Nowadays they all have proper meters which show exactly how much to pay. 
4. The nearest Metro station is Ravindra Sadan Station, and its about a ten minute walk from there. The walk is pleasant, and you can enjoy the flavor of the city on the way. Otherwise get your cab to drop you off at any one of the gates. 
5. Target the latter half of the day, the Museum closes at 5-PM, and the Light and sound show starts after sundown around 7PM, so ideally plan to reach by about 330 pm. See the interiors, which involves some climbing.The stairs are steep and difficult for old people. After you come out (Assume one and half hour inside, at leisure), sit in the park outside and enjoy some packed food or street food (Very spicy mostly). You can watch the light and sound show outside in the evening. At times this show does not run, though. Enquire about that when you enter, so that you can plan accordingly. 
6. Lastly but most importantly - do not simply walk out of the Memorial, take photos and walk out. Spend a few minutes sitting on the grass or on one of the benches, look around. You will feel a lot of Kolkata in here. The city has its own feel which can be soaked in. This experience is invaluable. More",Aug-14

During busy times or holidays there is normally a spectacle put on. However, this does usually make the park even busier, and the queue to get in becomes horrendous (nearly a mile long at one point!). 
A museum can be found in the middle of the site too, as well as a statue of Queen Victoria. 

Not that many facilities are available though, and the toilets can be difficult to locate. The water features (fountains and canals) could be better looked after as well. More",Jan-15

Truly a touristic destination, I feel it should not be missed. Every visit to India, I never fail to take some time out just to take a walk in the beautiful Gardens around the Memorial Hall. Very large and spacious, it is a nice relaxing atmosphere to take in the perfect mixture of relaxation, serenity, culture and history. 

Having architectural elements from all parts of the world; British, Mughal, Egyptian and Islamic (to name a few) it is particularly interesting to pay special attention to the intricate details contributed from all these various cultures. Also there are a few sculptures to notice such as the ""Angel Of Victory"" atop the central dome of the memorial hall. 

Another funny fact is that the surrounding gardens is quite the lover's paradise where privacy constrained couples come here to avoid the public eye. Slightly odd to come across but either way its hilarious.

Need maintainence,Tinafactor,"Durgapur, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,3-Jan-15,"The VM is one of the most well known landmarks of Kolkata . I remember going there as a child, all big eyed and very excited. I was excited to revisit it after 3 decades only to be highly disappointed. I do not mind the crowd in historical places, it is expected. However , I do mind being charged a entrance fee and then seeing that my money is not being put to good use. The central hall is where all the glass showcases were kept with the displays along with some massive and impressive paintings. What struck me was the fact that there were pigeons in the hall and I was worried how their dropping might deface some of those beautiful pieces of art work. I walked a few paces and true enough I did see pigeon dropping on one of the plates which had information about a painting. As we took the spiral staircase, I was ashamed to see the place being used as a storehouse for old and broken furniture along with empty plastic bottles. A room on the top was open and that too was pretty dusty and had old showcases. Infact, I regretted going back inside the place and wished that my childhood memory was not destroyed by this reality.

A large extent of 64 acres of land is occupied by this memorial including the built area of 338’X228’. At the top of the central dome of the Victoria Memorial is the 16 ft (4.9 m) figure of the Angel of Victory. 

It was meant to be a museum where people could see statues of leaders who played an important role in Indian History. It was desired to develop pride on their part in building up Calcutta. It is first and prominent art museum. At present it is a museum and tourist destination under the auspices of the Ministry of Culture. The Memorial lies on the Maidan (grounds) by the bank of the Hooghly River and close to Jawaharlal Nehru road. You can see the boys playing cricket in this field. 

It appears that those British builders had an idea of constructing this memorial in white marbles as used in building Tajmahal by Shahjahan. They also intended to build it in memory to their empress. Its design may echo the Tajmahal when you look at its dome, four subsidiaries, octagonal domed chattris, high portals, terrace as well as the domed corner towers. 

Empress Victoria is seen as seated on her throne wearing robes of the Star of India. The other statues in the paved quadrangles around the building commemorate Hastings, Cornwallis, Clive, Wellesley, and Dalhousie. While entering the main building from the south you have to pass thru the Edward VII memorial arch and other items which may not entertain you. For a man, who is against the preservation of these old slave masters is a shame on our part. 

This is an important historical monument that makes us remember the days of slavery to the British. Victoria terminus was changed as Shivaji terminus. Likewise the name of this should also be changed as Rabindu memorial or in the name of a prominent patriot of Mother India. More",May-14

There are lots of paintings and artifacts from the British era. Not everyone know that the fairy on top of the building used to rotate 360 degrees. Unfortunately, it does not rotate any more. This heritage building is packed with details and paintings of Kolkata in the British era. Recently more items have been put on display for visitors. The surrounding area also has a beautiful charm. The ideal time to visit would be early in the morning just after sunrise in the summer. In the winter the ideal time to visit would be in the evening. You can enjoy a ride in the horse drawn carriages. Avoid visiting during national holidays like 15Aug and 25th decemeber, since there will be a sea of people visiting the place. Not very sure about the timings but make saure to have some time at hand to go through the gallery inside and soak in the winter sun.

However, even without entry inside the building, the memorial is worth the visit and the detailing in every structure is just awesome. The best memory is the face of a small child sculpted in different places - it was just mesmerizing. Also another must do is to take buggy ride just outside the memorial.

It was thrown open to public in 1921. The memorial itself is a museum where people can see a significant display of artifacts illustrating the Indo-British history. Amongst the exhibits spread over 25 galleries, you will find portraits of British royals, portraits of national leaders, arms, oil paintings by European painters , sculpture, historical photographs,rare books and manuscripts.Some of the interesting exhibits are the dagger of Tipu Sultan, a cannon used in the battle of Plassey, rare books that date back to 1870, valuable manuscripts like the Ain-i-Akbari by Abul Fazal, rare postage stamps. The gallery which I liked most was the Calcutta gallery which houses a visual display of the history and development of Calcutta from Job Charnock of the English East India company to 1911, when the capital of India was transferred to New Delhi. Apart from the permanent exhibits, every month certain objects of interest on a certain theme are displayed as objects of the month.

Coming to why I titled my review, I saw a group of young boys go and quietly spit out their mouths content on one of the walls near the stairs. When I reported the same to the lazed out ""guards"" , I was met with a very casual ""oh people do it all the time"".

Both British & Indian heritage,Vincent M,"New Orleans, Louisiana",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,10-May-14,"The Victoria Memorial was proposed by the Viceroy, Lord Curzon, immediately after the death of the Queen Empress. It was to be a splendid shrine to Victoria and a centerpiece of the capital of the Raj. By the time it opened, Calcutta was no longer the capital. Within 20 years after that, it was an open question whether there would even be a British Raj. And 20 years after that, the question had been resoundingly answered in the negative. Oh, we'll, it IS splendid. And even better, it is a monument to both the British and the Indians. The V.M. Manages to do homage to both.

Continue up and you walk round the upper gallery under the rotunda for a closer... The Victoria Memorial was proposed by the Viceroy, Lord Curzon, immediately after the death of the Queen Empress. It was to be a splendid shrine to Victoria and a centerpiece of the capital of the Raj. By the time it opened, Calcutta was no longer the capital. Within 20 years after that, it was an open question whether there would even be a British Raj. And 20 years after that, the question had been resoundingly answered in the negative.

The memorial, and gardens, are in the southern end of the Maidan, quite close to St Paul's Cathedral. You can spend two hours here. By my lights easily the most impressive attraction in Kolkata. If you come in the afternoon, you can cross the Maidan to also walk along the promenade overlooking the Hoogly at sunset. 

One tip: during the hot season, take a small folding umbrella along: a parasol really does make the walk much more pleasant. More",May-14

It is also fun to ride in one the horse-drawn carriages with my niece. Young lovers seem to particularly enjoy this garden.

If you live in one of the swanky hotels on Park street or the Esplanade area then definately try to come to this place for a nice morning walk. Otherwise try to come in the early evenig so you can visit the museum inside and have nice stroll round the sprawling property. (Avoid visiting with your parents....the couples around the bushes may embarass you.) once you are done with the stroll and thinking what to do next, just come out of the enrance and travel through time taking a ride on the chariots. You have to hackle the price a bit,quote half of what they are quoting and settle for 3/4 th price. It generally works. He will take around Maidan, a sprawling open grounds which belongs to the Indian army, but is the heart of kolkata sports lovers. you may catch glimps of budding cricketers or footbllers in the making in this place. once you are done with the ride you should come back to victoria to enjoy the light and sound show.

Parking is a hassle. You have to find a slot quite some distance away and then come here. Best would be to park your vehicle at any convenient close by place and take a taxi to see Victoria memorial and the other places close by. More",Dec-13

Now it goes in to the list of Heritage buildings and no one can remove it from that place. It is going to be there for life time, for ever. And keep reminding us about our history. 

The building is built by marbles with huge dome in the center and lot of other compartments in it. Right now Koklata goverment had made it more butifull by keeping all historical thing inside. Good job done by them. 

Out side garden is soo big and so butifully minatain that everyone wants to spend their time with peace of mind. It might look even butifull in the night. I dont get chance to see it in night. 

Cametra is not alloweed insode of the building but you can take pictures from outside. Visit of half day is better to sped good amount of time. Childers might not intrested to visit becase its all abot history and knowing old and culteral things. Better keep them at home or at hotel. More",Mar-14

Awe-inspiring! Must visit,Avrag2014,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Feb-14,"One can stand & stare forever at this captivating monument and indication of the colonial British rule. 
Despite being in the main city, the place is amazing silent. The place is easily accessible and as you walk by the compound wall, you can get a picturesque view of the Victoria Memorial, the pond and the gardens. 
The gates are grand with two majestic lions on either side. A graveled path leads to the historic monument which is flanked by ponds on both sides and the water is sparkling clear. The garden is beautiful with lush green grass & flowers of different hues. Cranes & birds flock here. The settings which house the Victoria Memorial are charming. 
A powerful statue of Queen Victoria welcomes all visitors. The Victoria Memorial in itself is a grand & imposing monument in white marble. Each inch of the monument is beautiful. There is museum inside, which is just as historic and attractive. 
The maintenance of the place is exemplary despite a measly entry ticket of Rs.10/-(for Indians) More",Feb-14
A must visit place at Kolkata.,Sadique_1983,"Rangpur, Bangladesh",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,23-Feb-14,Nice architectural building. I think every one will like this place. The park is also beautiful and well maintained. Please see the light and music show if you have enough time.,Feb-14
All that mpney and grandeur!,Lesley S,"Isle of Lewis, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,20-Feb-14,"Initially i could not get my head around the fact this massive place had been built and the woman never visited...I would have called it something else. Its very impressive, the outside better than inside. Just walk around the outside to get an overall view, fantastic! Once inside, you want to get your cleaning stuff out..and dust! Be careful of the over zealous guards, are they guards? Tell you off for breathing to close to the art!",Nov-13
"Good museum, nice retreat from busy streets",tysh19,"Evanston, IL",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,19-Feb-14,"The building and grounds are very attractive and the museum has a number of informative, interesting exhibits that shed a light on the history of Kolkata.

Beautiful British folly,911bella,Mid Sussex,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,13-Feb-14,"We'd visited Kolkata a number of times but never gone inside the Victoria Memorial. Glad we did this time. Apart for appreciating the grandeur of the central dome there's some pretty good exhibits; watercolours painted by British amateurs during the British period and a very good historical timeline mapping the growth and history of the city. 

Unfortunately you need to be careful around the ticket booth, there was a crowd when we were there and I emerged minus my mobile phone. 

It's a great piece of architecture even if slightly preposterous in its scale and design, I guess that's just historical perspective.",Feb-14
Tourist attraction,flemingmuir,"Shanghai, China",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,11-Feb-14,Gardens and surrounding park was beautiful but inside the museum was a bit dark and oppressive. In need of a bit of cleaning up. But from outside looks quite impressive.,Feb-14
Peace and Quiet,isitmany,"Hong Kong, China",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,11-Feb-14,"Not too many clean and quiet spaces in Kolkata, but this place seems to be the exception. It's a beautiful building and the grounds are well-kept. Not perfect, but nice. 

It seems that a lot of the colonial buildings in the city are now crumbling and awaiting redevelopment, so it's nice to see that the memorial is kept in good shape and locals and visitors alike can enjoy the space.",Jan-14
Beautiful,Felix L,"Christchurch, New Zealand",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,11-Feb-14,"A beautiful structure, reflecting the height of the British rule here. The gardens are beautifully maintained, and a nice place to relax, away from the usual chaotic street noise. But you can't hide from locals, who swarm there for the relatively peacefulness and nice lawns. Also, Kolkata doesn't see many tourists, so if you don't look Indian, (especially if you're a blond girl), you'll get a lot of attention (and guys will stare/ogle).",Dec-13

Good exteriors,prasoonr,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,8-Feb-14,We liked the building and the gardens more than the visit inside. The museum inside gets very crowded and there arent many people to guide the people.,Oct-13
A stunning must-see attraction for Kolkata,RaamT,"Coventry, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,6-Feb-14,"This place is phenomenal; it's grandeur, legacy and architecture are nothing short of breath-taking. It's a shame that the Indian guardians aren't looking after it as well as could be the case, with many displays and artefacts falling into disrepair. It was a shame as the upper floors were shut when we went, but do check them out as they house the sword of Tipu Sultan amongst other artefacts. Also, do try and pay the local rate (Rs. 10 per person) as opposed to the 'Foreigner rate' - a blatant rip-off at Rs.150.",Oct-13
Stunning...,997richardp,"Perth, Australia",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,5-Feb-14,"A beautiful place that is well maintained...a fine example of how the rest of India could be if everybody stopped throwing their trash and rubbish everywhere... 

A lovely oasis amidst the Kolkata centre...",Feb-14
Nice place,rohitvashisteo,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,2-Feb-14,"The best thing about this memorial is not the impressive marble building nor the museum inside...it's the gardens surrounding the memorial. They are really well maintained and give you a calm feeling bang in the middle of a very busy area of kolkata. The trees and the landscaping makes you literally forget that there are thousands of vehicles jostling for space just a stone's throw away from here.Certainly a place to visit in the evening , if nothing else you can just sit and enjoy by the side of the water body with birds chirping and the sun setting . 
Regarding the specifics , the entry ticket is Rs 10 for both the museum and the gardens and only Rs 4 for the garden. There is also a sound and light show in the evening if you are interested in the same. A must visit place in kolkata More",Feb-14

Imperial Touch.,Sayeedac1,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,1-Feb-14,"Victoria Memorial Hall has to be visited on a tour of Kolkata, for tourists as well as for the locals. It's a grand place of bygone days when the British ruled India with the capital in Calcutta now known as Kolkata. It is a single building with high ceiling and filled up with paintings of the Britishers. Some statues too. It has extensive grounds all around it with trees and a pond. Unfortunately no photography allowed. Visitors are aplenty. Well worth spending an hour or two visiting this place which will remind one of the grand days of the Raj.",Jan-14
memorable place,Gaurav62,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,31-Jan-14,"One of the memorable place in kolkata. Beautiful garden with many beautiful flowers. The hall contains many memorable contents of queen Victoria, like her dress, chariot etc.",Jan-14
I would have loved to take photos,hotcanvaswork,"Sydney, Australia",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,29-Jan-14,"Non Nationals 150 Rupees to enter and you do get a big ticket but the locals pay only 50 rupees and the line is the same one and the jostling and pushing is the same for all. Very popular, long slow lines going in a set direction.NO Photos. The first gallery is devoted to local modern art and would be far more enjoyable if they had not put in a low celling and lots of hot lights. The original celling would have allowed more fresh air in. Yuk. 
the rest is fantastic and you can view the lofty cellings and admire the construction. The paintings of Calcutta from the past show what a beautiful city it once was. Then there is the gallery on the history of the city very good, excellent! More",Jan-14
Great attraction ruined by shocking experience,Lucy L,"Plymouth, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,28-Jan-14,"My good friend from Kolkata took me to see this historical building and clearly, major tourist attraction, and of course if you like these things you must go. It is all that the good reviews say. But my experience was ruined by the experience of totally unnecessary animal cruelty outside of the venue, (and by no insinuation associated with the VMH). On the Turf Ground opposite, the most beautiful white horses are made to pull huge carts whose iron wheels, when clumsily halted, tear apart their hooves from their legs or tear flesh in great agony. These beasts were also clearly underfed and the tourists that sat upon them, or in the carts, were largely overfed. Later that same day, passing by on foot once more, I saw a man leading a horse so parched its tongue stuck straight out like a stiff pink stick beyond its rasping mouth. It was horrific. The horse cannot have lived beyond that day. This is an unacceptable way to may a living, when tourists can easily spare a few more rupees to buy a bucket, if that is all that is needed, to fetch these innocent animals water more often through the day. A wooden guard can be fitted before the cart to protect hooves. And there should be both a weight limit on back rides, and above all, compassion as part of the tourist experience, not this shameful animal cruelty. I have...

I have seen other horse and cart operators in the city operate to higher, compassionate standards but the particular one I describe above needs alerting to their internationally unacceptable standard. And others who perceive this must not support this financially and speak out: as a means of protest, and as direct action towards change. I look forward to the day that people go to this place and find that my views here are outdated and irrelevant, and that human beings and animals are working more effectively and compassionately side by side.

Nice Memorial Hall,sanaser,Ludhiana,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,26-Jan-14,Victoria Memorial Hall is a famous tourist place in Calcutta.It looks like Tajmahal at Agra. It is a knowledgeable hall for young generation.,Dec-13
Magnificent,adityamukhija,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,26-Jan-14,"Situated at the heart of the city, its truly an architectural beauty. Built during Imperial India, its still very well maintained. It persists of a museum, with a vast collection of art works from paintings to antiques. The architecture both internally and externally is amazing and along with spacious lavish green spaces. It was my first visit to Kolkata, and was surprised around the fact that the city had numerous open spaces to sit, relax or even play during the evenings. A blessed environment and a very photogenic area of Kolkata!",Nov-13
The City's Most Undeniable Sight,camsean,"Chengdu, China",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,25-Jan-14,"Kolkata is a city which has often conjured up images of horror for Westerners. The phrase ""The Black Hole of Calcutta"" lingered in popular usage for over a century. It is somewhat surprising then that while the city does have a lot of grime, decay and poverty, it also has some beautiful buildings, and is a very worthwhile destination. Its main drawcard is probably its remarkable collection of Raj-era buildings. Most of them are in a lamentable state of repair, and the Communist government has a lot to answer for. But Victoria Memorial Hall is well looked after and it is an astonishing piece of architecture worth lingering in. 

Notable for its monumental size, its lavish use of white marble and its fine collection of statues, friezes and other ornamentation, this is an uncommonly elegant construction. The collection of Raj-era paintings and drawings adds a sense of history. The museum housed in the building is a very good introduction to this most British of Indian cities. Finally, the surrounding garden is a tranquil getaway from the maddening hubbub of Kolkata outside, Plan on spending quite a while here. More",Jan-14
a royal touch,marblehub,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,25-Jan-14,"Victoria memorial is a heart of calcutta, surronded with lush green field. Its a place where 1 can walk along and enjoy the aroma of lush green field. We can see horse riding, beautiful architecture work in the victoria monument done is hearth loving. After on walk one can relax on and have local street munch with soft drinks of various kinds. Munch like, muri (puffed rice), pukcha ( spice water balls) etc etc. An evening here will cherish your memory after visit throught out life wherever comes in mind.",Jan-14

Well worth a visit,tembi1,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Jan-14,loved this building and the setting - great way to get a break from the noise and bustle of the city. Foreigners price and local price but i dont mind that at all. Museum inside was too comprehensive too much information to take in at one time but very well laid out.

A must visit place.",
Extraordinary erection in Kolkata,Peter S,"Canberra, Australia",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,23-Jan-14,"The Victoria Memorial was opened in (I think) 1921. Just 26 years later the Raj had ended. It's an extraordinary testament to the delusion that empire was forever. Today it is quiet well preserved, and has had a makeover since I first saw it in 1986. There is a very good (if unduly detailed) gallery on Bengal/Calcutta history, and an interesting if not well lit temporary exhibition of art. The only disappointment is that photography is forbidden (i.e. has to be done surreptitiously …)",Jan-14

"Interesting paintings, architecture, statues and gardens",Sasha M,"Sydney, Australia",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,19-Jan-14,"You could spend a couple of hours here. The building is quite grand with several rooms of paintings and displays. The paintings are particularly well maintained and give a glorious insight into the period of the raj and the east India company. We were there on a religious festival day, so the crowds were enormous. There was no problem getting in, but the slow movement through the museum areas was hampered but the river of people flowing through at a pace pushed on by the ever present whistle blowing guards. The cost is 150 rupees for foreigners, so we made sure we stopped when we wanted to and the tide flowed around us. If you are into people watching then this is the place to do it with some comfort as the gardens outside offer benches and grassed areas to sit on. More",Jan-14

It's okay,SunnieNiklaus,Chicago,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,15-Jan-14,"Happy I went as the grounds are beautiful. The building itself is stunning. 
The information inside the building is interesting. For me, it was hard to see how little care is put into preserving for the art inside the building. 

Have correct change if possible. I didn't and it took a bit of convincing for them to take my Rs.1000 note. When they did finally accept it the guy shorted Rs. 100 in my change. Annoying, but not all that surprising. 

I walked there from Sudder Street. I'd recommend walking there, great way to see more of the city.",Oct-13

Although the building is already very impressive from the outside it is really well-worth the visit, not just the building but also the surrounding gardens which are lovely. The exhibition is interesting but may not be for everybody (not particularly well put together but lots of paintings giving an impression of the Raj, Calcutta in the old days, and Independence movement). Somewhat puzzling why we were not allowed to take pictures inside though, especially from the statues which have surely faced tougher tests of time than my non-flashing cell phone camera.

But the Museum is lack-lusture. The exhibits are very few and certainly need cleaning. The inside of the memorial building have been recently painted, and the quality of paint used seems to be very cheap and just doesnot look good at all. The touch-kiosks are defunct and seem to be a waste of funds now. Would love to see more area dedicated to constructing village exhibits and more on the history of Bengal.",Dec-13

A Remarkable Building tribute to Victorian grandeur,anubrama,"Navi Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,8-Dec-13,"This building is as much a defining landmark of Kolkata nee Calcutta as the old Howrah Bridge. The rotating dark angel with the hooter at the top of its spire is in contrast to the marble dome, the architecture of sprawling proportions which has Corinthian and Greco Roman influences besides a bit of local engraving and Italian style (Michael Angelo) Fresco work adorning its edifice. The garden itself is a wonderful green space, with the horseman atop the arch on one side, and the seated statue of the Great Dame herself for whom this building serves as a memorial on the other side. The columns of marble on the side remind one of the Colosseum in Rome. Inside the building there is space for depicting the story of this building, adorned by the statue of Edward and Mary on either side, with Victoria in her prime at the centre under a huge dome, which has black marble etching in the fashion of the crown, which can be viewed from its full glory from the second floor. The roof of the building has a series of frescoes depicting the life of Victoria from her ascension to her laying in State.

The stairwells are a bit narrow on the descent, some aisles are blocked midway to prevent the viewer from having a full view in the upper floors. The steps are a bit on the steep side for both children and old. No photography is permitted inside the Memorial. This is a major irritant as one can make no sense of why such a restriction operates in this modern era! 
We can remember the first invitations to the inauguration of the Memorial, that Victoria passed away in 1901 after more than 60 years as Queen, that she gave her proclamation to Indian Princes and Princely States through which she made herself Empress of India, and she promised to uphold liberty and rule of law through her possessions to all her subjects, by instruments of her Reign. 
There is a single cannon in bronze cast and placed on the floor at the ground level, and there are two more levels in the building which offer a good view of surrounding Kolkata especially from the great balcony on the first floor. We went with our daughter, who was disappointed that her photo-op with Victoria was deleted by the security guard who spoke chaste Bengali, but whose intentions were unmistakable! 
There is apparently a Sound and Light show in the evenings as well as a musical fountain in the maidan opposite the memorial after dark. The 'Victoria' outside are glamorous horse carts, glittering in mirror and metal work, which take you around the maidan and within the view of the Victoria Memorial which line up outside on the thoroughfare in the evenings! This is much like the horse carriages at Gateway of India at Mumbai.

Victoria Memorial stands out supremely against the backdrop of the lush green grounds known as the Maidan. The entire edifice is made of white marble and the fairy at the very top would rotate with the draft. Sadly, the fairy does not rotate any more cause of lack of maintenance. 

The inside is spectacular in its very large oil paintings of the Lords, Governors and the Queen herself. It is so quiet and serene inside that you would want to linger on for some more hours.

Inside you have a museum of lot of paintings, display of armory, guns, and other things which are of great interest to anybody. It takes an awful long time to really look at things and to crown it all, the magnificent statue of Queen Victoria takes your breath away. For me and my house guests, it was a pleasant experience. 
Only negative part is we had to park our car too far away from the main entrance that day but I had a chauffeur so it was okay for me. When you are driving if you park too far off, you have to walk that extra distance to the Hall. Aside from that, overall, it was a great experience, one that I want to repeat again. More",Jan-13

We couldn't tell where one class stopped and another began unless there was an age difference. They totally made the trip because they were all excited to say hi to us. The gardens are also very beautiful. We went early-ish in the day which was nice so it wasn't too hot walking around. More",Jun-12
Mind-blowing beauty of the Victoria Memorial,abtmKolkata_India,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,8-May-13,"Victoria Memorial Hall is one of the historic pride of Kolkata. This architectural white marvel hall is situated in the center, surrounded by green meadows, beautiful flower gardens, artificial lakes & fountains; which of course enhances the charm of the surroundings.This is an awesome romantic place. One can escape from the monotonous din & bustle conditions of the city life & can spend leisure hours after hours. Photography is allowed only outside the hall that is in the park or beside the lake side. It remains all day open through out the year (even on holidays):5.30am-7pm. One can also enjoy the horse-cart ridding on the road, just adjacent to the Victoria Memorial.

Lots of well explained exhibits in date order as you tour the impressive building. Gets really busy on weekends when we visited, best time to go probably during a weekday. Like some other venues charges 150 rupees entry fee for foreigners but only 10 for locals. Worth the fee though. Gardens are pleasant too, a nice escape from the city. Toilets perhaps not so convenient though, are near staff quarters in a corner of the park. No photography or video allowed inside. Usual security check before entry.

As with all tourist sights in India, foreigners must pay 15 times more than Indians, but unlike so many other sights you can actually see where the money goes. The grounds are well maintained, the building is in great condition and the exhibition inside is a really decent effort. It's not a patch on the elegance of the taj but the architecture is nonetheless impressive: Italian renaissance with an Indian influence. The beautiful interior is quite spectacular and access is granted to explore much of the building. The grounds are a nice place to sit and relax (technically visitors can buy a cheaper ticket to just sit in the grounds but I'll bet foreigners have a hard time getting the lower price!)

But you dont need to worry about that. The exteriors, the gardens, the lakes themselves will make your day. Its very picturesque and a treat for the eyes.

The bronze plates at the entry are beautiful pieces and so is a majestic statue of the Queen. 
The painting sections is a good lesson in indian architectural wonders and are fine examples of contemprary painting during the Raj period.

Remembrance of the British Raj with a spice of Indian History,TimothyScanlon,"Washington, District of Columbia, United States",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,28-Jan-13,"I lived in this city for upwards of two years and never got to Victoria Memorial. That was my loss. 

Any literate person knows of the British (Tea Co.) imperialism in India. And Kolkata--then Calcutta--was for a long time the Vice Regal Capital. So we remember her dominance over the Indians with such a monument to royal authority. 

But the Bengali government has made somewhat of an art gallery out of the beautful building, and has included much of the country's economic history, e.g., crafts people heading to the cities in the 19th century but finding no work. So they ended up among India's untouchable paupers. It's not unlike what's going on today in the ""developed world,"" though on a scale probably more dramatic then and there. 

If you make it to the city I ""love to hate and hate to love,"" don't miss this building. I'm not sure why foreign nationals pay a lot more to enter than do Indians. (It should have cost me Rs. 150, but they charged me Rs. 200, and I think it's free, or almost for Indians). But it's definitely worth seeing, and learning from.

Best place in Kolkata to visit,mebiner,"Covina, California",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Jan-13,"I spent a couple of days in Kolkata and visited the Victoria Memorial 4 times! It is my favorite place to visit in the city and here are some tips: 

1. Visit at sunrise (gardens open at 5:30 am; ticket costs 4 Rs, about 8 cents US) and get beautiful photos of the sunrise from across the reflecting pool on the northwest side of the memorial. 

2. Daytime visit - enter from the south side (sunlight makes the south side more beautiful than the shady north side) and walk around the east side (before noon) or west side (afternoon) for great photos across the small reflecting pools directly east or west of the memorial 

3. Evening visit - sound and light show at 7:15 pm - 8 pm (20 Rs, or 40 cents US), ok, but they illuminate it nicely afterwards and you can get a nice photo (with tripod ideally) across the east reflecting pool). 

4. The interior of the memorial is like a super-detailed history lesson and we didn't find it worthwhile. It costs 150 Rs ($3) for foreigners and the guards inside are constantly blowing their whistles at visitors who shoot photos (which are prohibited inside) or touch something they aren't supposed to.

There's several exhibitions inside including one detailing the colonial history of Kolkata from 1690 to 1912 (including a lot of detail that might be omitted by 'western' historians) and another about famous Bengalis / Kolkatans.

You get a very good sense of the British East India Company history along with the evolution of the City of Calcutta. While some of the languages on the exhibits were probably flawed owing to British perceptions, there is still a lot to see and understand how the East India Company evolved, start of the social reform and some of the key figures who took part in the reform / later independence struggle. Gives a really good sense of importance this city enjoyed in the British Empire. It is, however, a little disappointing that all British figures are shown in glowing colors, while denigrating practices in India - to some extent it appears as mostly written by British historians with their frames of reference. There are also a number of interesting paintings - mostly about locations by British painters that are the only glimpse I have had about life in 18th / 19th centuries in India.

Inside the memorial is well worth a visit, the building is equally as grand on the inside, containing numerous colonial era statues and historic paintings – note photograph is forbidden inside. Perhaps to offset the ‘Britishness’ of the memorial, there is also a small museum of selective history on various Indian Independence figures. A brisk 30 or slower 45 minutes should cover a walk around the interior. There is also a light and sound show at night but I did not visit this. 
Note: If visiting early there were hardly any people at the memorial, but the structure was difficult to photograph from one direction due to the low lying sun and heavy haze (approx. 10AM). We returned in the afternoon around 3PM, and although the site was busier, light conditions were far better for the photographer – many people had set up tripods by the reflective pools to catch the memorial at sun down.

Should see it from outside,randomtraveller1234,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,8-Nov-12,"Victorial memorial hall is a beautiful landmark in Calcutta. From the outside the park is beautiful and you can see families and people just taking a break/hanging out. 

The downside is that once you're inside, I guess because of too many people, there are security guards that herd you like cattles. If you're taking too long to look at an art piece, these securities guards will whistle at you and then yell at you to get a move on. Also, there is no AC inside so it gets really hot and humid in there. It is beautiful from the outside so we really enjoyed the beautiful architecture but can't say it was true from the inside.

Ok... But not well looked after inside,sam2013,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,7-Oct-12,"The grounds are lovely and a stroll across the Maidan towards Victoria Memorial is pretty special. However, people who are visibly 'foreign' are charged at least 5 times more than 'locals'... Once inside, this price buys you a pleasant walk around the (relatively) well-maintained gardens, watching young couple's illicit canoodling under the trees and getting hassled for photos by generally friendly Indian tourists if you stop for more than 10 seconds . 

Inside, the hall - which must once have been grand and impressive - is a noisy, dusty and sweaty ordeal where you are pushed and jostled round past exhibits and displays in dire need of cleaning. It's possible that there are some interesting things to see inside, but the sounds of spitting, mobile phones and the throngs of uninterested people a a colossal impediment to concentration. 

It's difficult to see where the inflated entrance fees go as there seems to be little investment in cleaning and preservation and yet another of Kolkata's tourist attractions sadly depreciates, neglected and forlorn, by the day 

Victoria memorial is in many ways the opposite of most buildings in kolkata - it's well maintained (almost looked-after) from the outside, but a dilapidated disappointment inside. At night, though, it is worth walking round to see it lit up and resplendent. More",

The fact that it sits in the center of one of the most chaotic and dirty cities in the world is equally incredible in its improbability.

Now once inside you will see dedicated sections on British rule, history of the memorial itself, Britishers who were responsible for creating this place. Its also has two shops on the ground floor where you can buy souvenirs on the paintings etc in the form of books, mugs and other things. you will find museum on how people used to live under the British rule, things used the revolutionaries, items of daily use , portraits of Gandhi and , life size paintings both by Indian and Foreign Artists.

Colonial Gift,Aniket J,"Pune, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,29-Apr-12,"The Victoria memorial is a treat, especially for the aesthetically inclined. The memorial is known for its architecture. The architects of this memorial borrowed certain aspects of Mughal architecture, especially the Taj Mahal. It is built with the same type of marble (Makrana Mrable) with which the Taj was built. The fusion of british, mughal and indian architecture is evident. 
Inside, one can see many memorabilia and paintings of the British era. Life size statues and portraits of the british generals, the Marathas and the Peshwas, Indian monuments are a visual treat. 

'Must See' tip: 
If you like paintings, you have more to see inside the memorial than the outside. There is a plethora of stunning paintings on display. The paintings of Peshwas(Maratha warriors) are splendid. 
If you are an avid photographer, keep some time for strolling through the lawns in front of the memorial. One can catch a picturesque glimpse of everyday life here ! 

'Getting There' tip: 
Take a metro or bus to Esplanande. A 2.5km walk from esplanade to Victoria Memorial,through the lush green lawns, is enlivening. More",Jun-11

A good idea would be to enter the building around 3PM and see the inside of the building for about1-2 hrs then stroll in the garden or take a walk around the place or to the Birla Planetarium just 5 minuts away and come back for the light show at around 7:15PM.The entry for Light show is from East gate which is open till 7:30 PM for about 30mints.

Grand edifice to Queen Victoria,bacchaebabe,Sydney,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,31-Mar-12,"This is really quite a grand building with extensive well kept gardens. It's Rs.10 for locals and Rs 150 for foreigners but you get a big ticket with a nice picture on it. 

You need the ticket to get inside and unfortaunely you're not allowed to take photos once inside. No idea why as they have most of the paintings just on the walls in the 30 degree heat so I doubt very much that a flash from a camera would do any further damage. Inside is like a museum, with quite a few paintings from colonial times, some old weapons and an area that describes the British arriving and the impact they had in terms of trade, colonisation and the changes they brought, which were quite significant. It's actually very interesting and quite depressing and embarrassing. This part was air conditioned. Upstairs are more paintings and more history of some of the local leaders. You can't get into the dome area upstairs which is a shame as it would be a bit like St Paul's whispering gallery I would imagine.

The tickes for the Light and Sound show are available at the east gate of Victoria Memorial and very reasonably priced. Summer and Winter timings are different. The shows are in two languages-Bengali and English. Photography is allowed.

By all means go see it, if nothing else it will allow you to get away from the masses as the grounds are nice and spacious, but not expect any revelations. When we went there was actually an exhibit of local Indian art inside which we found the most interesting. Again, it's not Taj Mahal, but if you can't get to the Taj Mahal, it's certainly a nice place to visit.",Dec-11

Stunning building in well-kept gardens.,Headwealth,"Melbourne, Australia",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,5-Dec-11,"My partner and I visited the Victoria building upon recommendation from a local couchsurfer and it was a worthwhile addition to our trip. Our Kolkata-couchsurfing-buddy told us not to bother with the full-priced admission and we took his advice opting for the meagre 4 Rupee ticket to enter only the grounds. I'm not sure if we missed out on anything by not going inside, I don't feel that we did because this building is spectacular to behold from the gardens and we had a lovely afternoon wandering around and enjoying the many park benches! 

The walk back to our hotel (the Broadway on Ganesh Chandra Ave) was a decent trek but a nice way to see a bit more of the city. More",Nov-11
Definitely worth going to. Kolkata's Central Park,Juanbuddha,Melbourne,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,5-Dec-11,This place was a great way to spend a few hours in the afternoon one day travelling around Kolkata.

The building was even better than I thought it would be so worth going to if you have the time.,Nov-11

With my friends and with my spouse. Its a very good place. You can find various size and colored stones on roads inside Victoria. The palace is made with white marbles..

A potted history of Calcutta and great gardens.,coastalchris,"Wiltshire, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,24-Oct-11,"Pick the wrong day and the exhibition halls can be a hot, crowded and difficult place to view, popular as it is, with Indian residents. You cannot just roam around; rather the guards blow their whistles to force the masses of visitors to move in a clockwise direction around all halls. Hesitate and you are likely to have a whistle blown in your ear to keep you moving, although western visitors seem to be subjected to this les than the poor locals. The grounds and lakes are a major attraction, offering a relatively quiet and airy place to walk or sit in what is otherwise a steaming, humid city. Pony drawn carriages are available outside the grounds but take one look at the terrible condition of the poor animals and I hope you will think twice about using their services. More",Oct-11

The monument that defines Kolkata - the city of joy,Earn2Travel,"Parsippany, New Jersey",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Oct-11,"you cant really have toured Kolkata (erstwhile Calcutta), the once capital of the British India, and have not seen Victoria Memorial hall. This is Quintessentially, one of the best sights of the city and a Must Go. 

The location is probably the best part of the city, you are close to other attractions like the Birla Planetorium, St. Paul's Cathedral, Citizen's PArk, The vast Expanses Of Maidan, Indian Museum, the throbbing Park Street and the Raj Relic - the Race Course, all in walking distance. Ofcourse on the western Front you have the splendid Vidyasagar Setu (the 2nd Hooghly bridge) and a short taxi ride to nearby Princep Ghat in the evening would give you a stunning sunset panoramic view that you would remember for your life time. 

The Victoria Memorial hall monument by itself is one piece of exquisite example of marble architecture. Coupled with the splendid waterbody in campus and the lush green lawn interspersed by the greenery of trees make the outdoors a great place to be. Inside, you have a museum of Raj Relics. 

You really wouldn't want to miss it for all your money. More",Sep-11
Important collection of history of Bengal/Kolkata in beautiful old English building..but..,MrShhh,"Shepparton, Australia",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,5-Oct-11,"Kolkata O' Kolkata...the state of this important monument is, in my opinion, a pretty clear reflection of the ""laissez faire"" attitude of management of West Bengal. Kolkata has such potential for tourism but it really is pretty hard to recommend (and I love travelling in India!!). 
The grounds from the entrance are really run down with quite a bit of rubbish blowing around. I am glad I had my trekking boots on because I rolled my ankle twice on broken/ rough paving walking to the entry. Be very careful if you are elderly or infirmed- wear sturdy shoes. 
The collections inside are a bit dry and if you only have a passing interest in the local history then you will have to dig deep for gems of real interest. What doesn't help is the layers of dust and the poor lighting, it was also quite warm inside with little air circulation when I was there. 
All in all I spent 3 hours here and did gain a deeper understnding of the history and took away 5-6 things that I studied further- AND I found the reason why the local old english gravestones have split dates of death i.e. 1860/1. When you go there see if you find the reason! More",Dec-10

Amazing experience,Prasanta B,FARIDABAD,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,28-Aug-11,"Kolkata was the capital of British India.Kolkata is a city of palaces and Victoria Memorial is one of them. If one visits Kolkata and does not see this historical building then his visit will be incomplete. Its unique architecture reminds us of Roman palaces. It was built by the British empire during the visit of queen Victoria. There are other historical buildings like the Fort, St Pauls Cathedral, Museum, Dakhineswar Temple, Kalighat Temple,Jain Temple and many more. 
Kolkata is a vibrant city of many cultures living in perfect harmony. You will even find a China Town where Chinese people live as if they are in China. Kolkata is shopper's paradise. One can find everything one wants to buy in its endless busy markets.Kolkata is also famous for its night life. One can enjoy till wee hours in its bars,pubs and restaurants spread across many parts of Kolkat. 
Above all there is the river Ganga flowing majesticaly through Kolkata. One can take long trips in boats and see the amazing city from a completely different angle. And the night view from the boat is simply mind blowing. More",Dec-10

One of the two places that are worth seeing in Kolkata,utas2010,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,10-May-11,"This was the only building that we visited in Kolkata, which was worth it. The building itself is nice (although for a European it is nothing special at all, just anoher large palace, you will find hundreds that are better in Europe), the gardens are really well-kept and peaceful. But what really makes it worthwhile visiting is the exhibition detailing Kolkata's history. It is the best place we have found in India to understand how the English lived in the Raj.

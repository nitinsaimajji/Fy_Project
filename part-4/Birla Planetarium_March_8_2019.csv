Birla Planetarium,Soumyajit S,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,28-Feb-19,"Birla Planetarium is located in Maidan area of Kolkata.

Awe-Inspiring Experience,Tharpo,"Noida, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,13-Feb-19,"It's fact that I took long years to visit this place. But better late than never, indeed it is an overwhelming experience. They have Carl Zeiss AG optical projection system, that's simply fantastic. We saw a program on ""Cosmic Collisions"". The half an hour passed like few seconds. Minuteness of our existence was well understood. Narration was by the Sundance Kid. They have different show timing for Hindi, Bengali and English narration. If you are visiting Kolkata it should be your No-1 pick.",Feb-19
Perfect on a rainy day in Kolkata,ohiowanderer,Columbus OH,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,8-Feb-19,"We attended the 6:30 PM show in English and it was very good. My friend had visited the Planetarium in 1982 and remembered it fondly. It was just as good in 2018. The show was narrated by Robert Redford, and you can't go wrong with Robert Redford. The show was about cosmic collisions. The planetarium was clean and had comfortable seats. After the show, take a look at the displays. And there are clean toilets, a luxury in that area. You cannot take big bags inside and have to leave them at a booth outside. I was a bit concerned about that but my backpack was safe.",Jul-18

VISIT TO THE BIRLA PLANATARIUM,Firdosh M,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,19-Dec-18,Went for the 1st 12.00 noon Show in Hindi language. Auditorium is well maintained. The show was a disappointment. Have seen better shows in Planatariums in various cities.,Dec-18
"""Up above the world so high""",saronichatterjee27,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,19-Dec-18,"we are habituated to look the dusky sky in Kolkata because of the increasing pollution. Birla Planetarium offers you to experience a clear view of night sky ( don't be serious, just enjoy). They conduct shows in different time schedule in Three laguages i.e.- Bengali, English,Hindi. You can easily follow the show(s) as per your choice. 

All the shows are quite informative .The shows are very much useful to the school students. Parents and teachers must come here with their children so that they can enjoy a live presentation of what they have learnt in their books. Show tickets are available for Rs.80 per head, but large group of students can enjoy discount also. 

The place is easily accessible from Maidan Metro. It is very near to Victoria Memorial and situated just next to the St. Paul's Cathedral. 

The only negative point about the management according to me is that, they don't allow you to buy ticket from the counter in advance. They start selling tickets just half an hour before the show. Because of that (as I didn't know the rule), I have to wait from 4pm to 6pm to buy tickets for 6:30 pm show and was forced to take the unnecessary long queue to collect my tickets. More",Dec-18

Science and technology give goosebumps as we see the new projection. Multilingualism is one of the best thing we can have. Astronomical information definitely mesmerizes anyone. 
Also good place to go with children as they would really like it. The planetarium have now been renovated into more stylish looks. The dome shaped auditorium along with the enhanced sound systems and good projectors give a thirilling experience to see the different meteorological shows.

A hidden gem of Kolkata while in open view,MissJenn808,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,30-Sep-18,"As a foreign visitor it might be easy to just pass by this planetarium while visiting nearby sights. However, the planetarium has a 13:30 and 18:30 viewing in English which I would highly recommend (only 80 rupees). We really enjoyed the show and learned a few new things about our solar system. The chairs are comfortable enough and there is AC. 

After the show there are still a few galleries to view, which I would suggest not to miss out on. I found it especially interesting to see paintings of Hindi deities (and the explanations of their connection to space) next to scientific explanations of our solar system. 

This was truly a great visit! More",Sep-18

Needs Improvements,Abhay55,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,5-Sep-18,"My visit to Birla Planetarium was bit disappointing. 

The first disappointment was that there was no proper arrangement for seating people who are waiting for the next show. There was no eatery where one can get some snacks or drinks while they are waiting. 
Despite all the big talk about digital India, only cash was accepted as Entry Fee. This only shows that the management is not adopting new payment methods. 
There was no punctuality as the show started nearly 7 minutes late and the announcer did not even apologize for the delay. Not surprising that people ridicule Indians by calling IST as Indian Standard Time. 
On the whole lots of changes needed. More",Aug-18

Amazing view of the Brahmand,MdZaff,"Asansol, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Aug-18,"We visited the planetarium in the afternoon. There were some techincal issues and the show started late. However, once the show started we were immersed in another world. The background narrative is excellent. We get to know our universe in a different light. Its great specially for kids. Added attraction is the displays about stars, planets, galaxies,etc which you can walk through before and after the show. Its a place to spend with the kids. However, there seemed to some technical glitch as one part of the space was completely black, maybe blackhole.",Jul-18
An sketchy tour of the cosmos,Suman Sankar G,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,22-Aug-18,"This is again a trip down the memory lane. I have come here as a child with my father and now i have come again as a father. But the place has lost its charm. The projection is jittery, the associated lecture is stern cold and brief. The toilet stinks and you can smell it even inside the planetarium. The chairs, are uncomfortable and broken. I am shocked at the level of neglect.",Sep-17
Get immersed in Universe!,Satish_at_VSSE,"Ahmedabad, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,6-Aug-18,"A must experience. There is a show about Universe and mega events happening in Universe.

A must see for any science buff especially kids interested in science.",Jul-18
One of its kind,NirmalSunkari,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,30-Jul-18,I went here as a child and returned to this amazing place after more than two decades.

An educative celestial experience.,Dhairyashil V,"Pune, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,3-Jul-18,"Birla Planetarium is a dome shaped single storeyed structure next to St. Paul's Cathedral. It conducts sky-shows for the public introducing them to astronomy and educating on subjects like the evolution of earth, mysteries of space, Mars and other planets etc. It also has interactive sessions for answering any doubts or myths about the space and the planets. The shows are very educative especially for the school going children who can get a glimpse into the cosmos through these sky-shows. The inside of the planetarium also houses pictures, busts of scientists, educative displays for the information of the visitors. The planetarium is a plastic-free zone. 

One thing we found strange was that our show was delayed by almost an hour as we were told by the management that as it was raining with lightening, the show could not be conducted as the lightening is causing disturbance to the signals ?? 

The sky-shows are conducted in English (1.30 & 6.30 pm), Hindi (12.30, 2.30 & 4.30 pm) and Bengali (3.30 & 5.30 pm). The shows last for about 40-45 minutes. Cost of Entrance Ticket is Rs.80/person. Additional shows in Hindi and Bengali are conducted in the morning on Sundays and Holidays. 

Overall an educative experience on the celestial happenings. More",Jun-18
A brief meeting with the STARS...,P_Sengupta2005,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,20-Jun-18,"It was an amazing experience, remembered the childhood days when I had first visited the place way back, my 7yrs old son was also not an exception in terms his ecstasy. 

Especially the new developments that they have, the visual effects after the renovation will catch the eyes.The constellations are so clear and goes to show how one can actually identify the zodiacs very easily after being lead to them virtually. 

Timing of the shows in different languages also makes it easy to comprehend for those who are comfortable with Hindi and Bengali apart from English. 

The only thing I felt could have increased the attraction was an online ticketing, which is still not introduced. But I hope in the future the authorities will provide online tickets to increase convenience for the viewers. 

In a nutshell its a pride of our city to have such marvellous destination in the heart of the city-centre... More",Jun-18

Preferably go for the English shows, because the explanations are easy to understand. 

The projections are excellent and way better than 3d movies. The narrations are top class and is very immersive. No matter what is your age. 

There are no seat numbers, so enter early. Go for the last row or 1st row. The projections are on the dome at the top, so these 2 rows give the best view. 

After the show do visit the galleries and the displays. 

Do not use mobiles with flash during the show, it's irritating and they ask you to stop doing it.

However after being closed for renovation for a long time, This October was my turn to taste the new flavour in old packet. 
And I must say I am amazed.. The presentation was superb 
At times I did feel that I was watching a 3D movie but without the glasses. 
The presentation from academic point of view was very informative,

Astronomically amazing,_mittal_cauvery18,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,9-Nov-17,"As the name says, it is about solar system. The graphical representation was jaw struck. It was very informative. Apart from short 30mins movie, there were well descriptive walls for each planet. The negative points were :- 
1. It was difficult to make out the front view of the movie. We thought the display will be same for all the sides but it was not. We had to shift our seats in the middle of the movie which distracted us and others. 
2. After the last show, the guards asked us to hurry because the planetarium was getting closed because of which we could not enjoy the descriptive walls much. Some time should be given between movie and exit for the last show. 
Overall, it was a knowledgeable visit! More",Nov-17
Journey through the Solar System - with a minor bump,Chandrani S,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,30-Oct-17,"The Birla Planetarium in Kolkata was revamped recently and we decided to pay a visit on a Sunday evening.

The seating arrangement has been modernized. The shows have been restructured as well. Earlier someone used to present in person and the whole sky was projected on the dome. So, you could get the view of the sky, reclining on your seat, from any place in the auditorium. However, now they played a video and it was mainly projected at one end of the dome, with just peripheral views on the whole dome. So it was really difficult to view from certain seats and one had to crane his or her neck to get a full view. So now if you visit, please seat at the seats opposite to the entrance, and not near the entrance. The show of 30 minutes was spell binding. One is bound to be awestruck as well as humbled, gliding within the solar system. The galleries have been revamped too. They display the mythological paintings of the planets and other celestial bodies, including Rahu and Ketu.

The planetarium is open all days and English shows are at 1.30 and 6.30 PM lasting 30 minutes. It is ideal to combine a visit to the planetarium with that of the Victoria Memorial located nearby. We were there on a working day and only about 5% of the 700 odd seats were occupied.The tickets are priced at Rs 70 and are sold half an hour before the show. There is a small room on the left called ""Astrocorner"" where you can pick up souvenirs. The premises are kept very clean though I saw some scraps inside the airconditioned viewing area. The staff are friendly. You are allowed to take photographs inside till the show starts. You can choose any seats .The initial background male voice is rather jarring but the subsequent commentary by Robert Redford is delightful. The idea to first show the Kolkata skyline before getting into the show is a good idea to give you the bearings. The show itself is very impressive and would recommend it to all. More",Sep-17

The children enjoyed the show and it was an hour well spent, But with the children exposed to latest technology it needs to be modernised if this wonderful infrastructure is to attract audience, I was happy to note from newspapers that upgradation is underway.

During this visit after nearly quarter century I was sorry to note that the building itself, and dome inside which is the projection surface is in bad shape, with patch marks marring the projection of celestial bodies. Evidently, the planetorium has suffered detrerioration. Even the show, and narration are quite elementary and do not expose the visitors to latest developments in astronomy and cosmology.

"As an astronomy enthusiast, not impressed",My2BareFeet,"Calgary, Canada",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,8-Dec-14,"The planetarium building itself, with its spherical theatre and futuristic projector at the centre, is impressive. However, the 30-minute show was overall quite poor. 

The English shows start at 1:30 pm and 6:30 pm. There was a long line up in advance of the Monday 1:30 pm show but there were plenty of seats once I got inside. 

The show was narrated by a senile woman who sounded like she didn't enjoy her job. Her accent and stuttering pace made her difficult and annoying to listen to, and was made worse by the bad speakers. The audio basically ruined the show for me. She talked about each of the planets, but their accompanying images were projected using a different cheap projector, and it showed. I was tired, but I didn't expect to fall asleep during the presentation. 

After the show there is a hallway where one can browse busts of famous astronomers of the past and images of space. However, many of these exhibits were of poor quality too and lacking in information, and don't add much value to real astronomy nerds. 

I think this is good for kids, but for older people with some basic knowledge of astronomy, this is impressive for the first 5 minutes, then goes downhill fast. More",Dec-14
National treasure! But not for building,catbaskets,"Dallas, Texas",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,30-Oct-14,"Old building, looks cool. Being renovated and it needs it! Do not go to first show of day, it's an absolute cluster of people literally fighting to get a ticket. Look up show times ahead to get appropriate language (English/hindi/Bengali). 

The show is elementary and basic, and not very advanced technologically. This place is stuck in the 80s, and that is what makes it cool. But the real treasure here is the lady narrating the show. She is old and doesn't give a flip what you think. She yells at people through the microphone who break the rules in the middle of the show. It is side-splittingly funny! If no one breaks the rules, turn on your phone and watch her go nuts! She made an otherwise boring experience so memorable! I hope to be like her when I am older, I genuinely respect her fortitude to uphold the rules! Keep it up!!! More",
Honestly good but many might not like it,358arvindn,"Pokhara, Nepal",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,20-Oct-14,"First things first, I like to follow astronomy in my free time. So, it was just expected that I will like it. I barely made it to the place on foot from Victoria Palace just on time to buy the tickets and watch the show. 

However, sometimes the speaker might lose patience with noises etc. So beware. Also, if you're too stupid or if knowledge and wonders of the universe is too much for you, better avoid this place. I saw many people coming out disappointed as if they expected it to be a Star Trek movie perhaps. 

Also, if you've already visited some other planetarium, it will almost offer the same thing. However the fact that its the largest in Asia and second largest in the World makes it a good enough contender for you to visit it atleast once. 

The movement of the stars and viewing of the whole galaxies etc was good and I must say that I was satisfied. 

TIPS : 
i. Look up the timings for the shows in English and plan accordingly. In my case I didn't and I was purely lucky. 

ii. The jhaal muri, chana outside was good. Can try. More",Dec-13

It is basically a place to take your kids...you are probably aware of all the things that will be told in the half hour long presentation but your kids will enjoy it. There are shows in three languages ...English , Hindi and Bengali .The price of ticket is 40 rs per head. I suggest you go for the English show if you are not afraid to be scolded. Yeah....that's right ...scolded. Their is an old lady who does the presentations and she is damm strict like a school teacher. She is very particular about kids screaming or mobiles ringing. I was amazed that she is stopped the presentation in between to scold some poor soul whose phone rang in the middle. She was also shouting her voice hoarse over some kids who just would not shut up. More than the presentation I was amused with this old lady .She made me and my wife relive the old school days. She was like the science teacher who was very strict but whose style of delivering lecture was boring and dull .I even caught a nap in the half hour long presentation...so dull was her speaking style. 
However the dome and the slides were impressive enough and if you have a sense of humor...you will also enjoy the lady and her tantrums...all in all a nice experience for an evening outing. More",Jan-14
Demonstration of facts and functioning of our universe in an attractive innovative way!,Sulagna_Das,"Noida, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,9-Jan-14,"Commonly known as “Taramandal”, The Birla Planetarium is the largest planetarium in Asia & the second largest planetarium in the world. The Planetarium is run by a society named M. P. Birla Institute of Fundamental Research, located near Maidan and adjacent to Victoria memorial and St. Paul’s Cathedral. The place successfully drives home points about our solar system, galaxy, stars and other heavenly bodies by means of twinkling lights, colorful models and painting displays. They demonstrate the facts and functioning of our universe and heavenly bodies with a light & sound show. The show is really very impressive....these kinds of informative shows are really very good and important for students. 
I visited the place by end of Dec 13. Seats were very comfortable. I could lean back completely and see the projection on the dome. The sound quality is also nice. Daily programs are conducted in English, Bengali and Hindi from 12:00 to 19:00 hrs. Programs are occasionally conducted in Oriya, Tamil and Gujarati, as well. Extra shows are arranged on holidays. The way they explain about the planet systematically is appreciable. Impression of Illuminated Kolkata was great!

The ticket charges of Rs 40 per head is a reasonable for the show. The shows are in Bengali, English & Hindi. We went for English show. The content was excellent. It gives a valuable input on the solar system. The presenter's English needs improvement so that the half an hour show on our solar system can be throughly enjoyed. Well maintained gallery but contents may be improved. 

Show starts from 1230 hours on weekdays & 1030 hours (optional) on Sunday's & holidays.",Dec-13
Not so impressive,NSDSVSMS,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,27-Dec-13,Have see other planetaria in India but this one did not live up to expectations.

disappointing,Dhwani,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,2-May-13,slides are atleast 30yrs old....some are torn and barely visible. theres more of a slide presentation with a old lady professor narrating the same story for many years....rather than making use of the 3d dome and AV system !,
Birla Planetarium is Great!,Travellingisgreat123,"Perth, Australia",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,22-Apr-13,I visited the Planetarium with my mum and we loved it! Other reviewers were correct in saying that it is something out of the 70s and that the presenter was unique and growls at people for having mobile phones going - people should have put their phones on silent anyway. I can see high quality images any day on the Internet or DVDs. We got out of it what we expected and loved it. It was a good experience for us!,Apr-13
Terrible Experience,sanjeev3aug,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,15-Mar-13,"Fee: Rs 40 per head (Waste of money)

Once u r seated the ambiance and music played is good. 
Good save you if u sat at the south. U will come out with head ache, Try it :) 
Presentation Starts... 
An old lady at times coughing and narrating about stars and planets. I felt like sleeping. The presentation dates back to old pics, cant understand why cant they download better slides available at google. The planetarium needs renovation both structurally and also with the presentation part. 
Better go to Science City planetarium... 
A MUST NOT GO!",Mar-13
Avoidable,Yogesh B,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,12-Mar-13,"Poorly maintained. Attended a 6.30 show in English. There was huge queue and had to wait for almost 45 minutes. By the time I entered the auditorium I was completely drained. 
There was an ancient lady giving the talk who was (understandably) harassed by a very unruly, uninterested crowd. She spent almost 10 minutes of the 30 minutes show screaming at the crowd to keep quite or switch off their mobile. Sadly, though it was a good effort, her presentation skills were pathetic. 
The presentation content was very very basic and boring. The slide resolution used for the presentation was very poor. By the end of the presentation, I was drained and wondering, what was I thinking when I bought the tickets.

Besides there's google and youtube nowadays. So I don't think that this is for goners like me... maybe for the younger generation but seriously, a 7 year old sitting for one hour? But here's good news, near this place is VIVALDA, it's a River Cruise on Ganges, where you pay 40 INR for 30 mins cruise on Ganges river, see the local boats, the longest bridge recently built, the rituals of religious people bathing on the river, and take photos with the crew on board.",Feb-13
Only for those who are interested in astronomy,SarthakN,"Indore, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,27-Jan-13,"To start, the place is now quite old, and so is the technology used.

M.P Birla Planetarium – Must See Object Near Kolkata Maidan,GrainVodka,"Jodhpur, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,23-Jan-13,"One of the beauties of Kolkata maidan that we found is its adjacency to various other places of interest. One such place is the M.P Birla Planetarium that is the second largest of its kind in the entire world. 

A spectacular asset of Modern Kolkata, the planetarium can accommodate 500 spectators. The planetarium has a single storey circular structure and is constructed with purely Indian architectural styles. With a diameter of 2 meters the central dome of the planetarium follows the Buddhist pattern of architecture. 

Technological marvel of the gigantic planetarium is that it has around 29000 parts that combines as accessories to create the inner part of the scientific structure. People are depicted the narration of solar systems in three languages in English, Hindi, and Bengali. More",Aug-12

Hillarious place with a coughing speaker,Yara Y,"Lisbon, Portugal",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,31-Dec-12,"This place was funny, the idea of a planetarium is great, but then... it had the indian twist which makes it really hilarious.

The narrator need to be changed. With all due respect, her voice is shaky and too straight. Seems she is in a hurry and reading the text to finish the show. Lady, it is time to quit ! This is not class room for lecture. 
The projector seems old. Presentation is not entertaining at all nor informative. The brightness of alpha stars is not too diff from the other stars. 
The exhibition has good photos and charts but, seems no one is interested - all are hung in the passage.

Some police officer who couldn't give a crap if I a bearded terrorist with a gun! There was a metal detector there which was completely pointless because it was in front of a no-entry zone! 
Oh, and don't get me started on the actual show! They employed some rude old lady to be on the loudspeaker during the show! a couple whispered to each other during the show and the old lady started yelling at them, over the loud speaker, so everyone could hear! No-one could hear the couple so it was completely pointless yelling at them! There were westerner's there and they were shocked and appalled at the behaviour of this lady! The Indians there were shocked too! Then a child started crying because it got dark and the rude old lady all of a sudden went very quiet. Everyone thought they were going to be yelled at again and so everyone was tense. 

The actual show was disappointing. The star effect was all right but the pictures were obviously just from Google images! An 8th grader could do better! 

Overall, it was disappointing and just embarrassing! I recommend tourists DO NOT visit here unless you want some old lady yelling at you because you whispered something to your partner. More",Jan-12

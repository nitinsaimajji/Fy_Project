A must visit,wanderer2174,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,6-Mar-19,"By reading reviews on tripadvisor, we were very eager to see Tagore's house. Rabindra Bharati University is painstakingly looking after this place which was donated to them by the family. The house is beautiful with history written everywhere... I was in awe of the whole place and especially Rabindranath Tagore's last days.. There are lots of exhibits and one will need 3-4 hours to see the whole place. Mind you, the second floor is not very well kept and things are dusty as is full Kolkata !! I wish they could have more funds to look after the place more better.. I think about 40% of the house is what we get to see and the rest of the building is not maintained and is shut down. I must add that the volunteers have done a great job of the light and music show in the evenings which ONE SHOULD NOT MISS... its a must watch and I was so delighted to hear Gulzar's voice. The house lights up so well and the yesteryears come alive with the beautiful story rendering done by talented artists which is famous in Kolkata.. the show is an historical wonder and I just feel they should add some fans for mosquitoes. The show generally starts at about 6.15 pm as daylight is now longer.. so maybe it may be delayed as summers' set in.. The people are wonderful and the visit to this house...

Pathetic,Peter s,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,31-Jan-19,"I left wondering what i had paid for. As a keen history buff, this place tells nothing that you couldnt get a better understanding free on the net. There is little continuity in the displays. In fact, some are even presented telling the story in reverse. There is almost nothing displayed of the original life. Furniture mostly gone. Lots of concrete. They charge additional to take pics of the outside of the building. For what. It is a construction of minor architectural interest other than to show how the few lucky privileged lived walled off from the squallor and filth outside. They dont allow pictures inside at all. For what? There is almost nothing worthy of a pic inside and virtually nothing original. A waste of time and money. Surely this privileged family could show more respect to their ancestor and see it is done properly. More",Jan-19

Jorasanko Thakur Bari is inseparable from the cultural heritage of all Bengalis. It is also one of the grand mansions of Old Calcutta, built in the 18th century. I was back after 10 years and glad to see that there are now exhibits devoted to Tagore's relationship with the US as well as China and Japan. And a whole new section on his final illness, surgery and death. Although the house is well maintained, the signage needs improvement. They will send you to the third floor first and it takes a while to figure out that this was where Tagore's grandfather lived. There are often few clues as to how other rooms were used and who were the residents. Instead, there is an overabundance of literary texts and artifacts. For Westerners, it can be a little perplexing, especially if you're not familiar with the history of the house, the family and Tagore's work. Some preliminary research is recommended.

The first few rooms, representing (I think) rooms he and his family spent most time living in, have a few photos on the wall, but not too much else. The most elaborate exhibits are from Tagore's travels (mostly in the later parts of his life) to foreign countries. The museum has halls for China, Japan, the UK, the US, and Hungary. These halls give perspectives of Tagore from a number of foreign points of view, and are not necessarily views that would be easily seen in a conventional exhibit.

They are rude and don't have a basic decency. I am not talking about the security guards, they are rather helpful. At the ticket counter, we were asked not to take pictures of the rooms but pictures of the garden could be taken with a special permission. The entry ticket costs Rs. 20 and the so-called ""special permission"" for photography cost another 50 rupees. The counters were closed by the time we reached the ground floor after viewing the upper levels and we couldn't take a permission. So we took a few selfies and photographs of ourselves barring the building areas. Out of nowhere came a personnel and just straight away asked me to delete the pictures. He was constantly looking at my phone's gallery to see what other pictures I had taken. So this is the behaviour you get when you visit heritage site in Kolkata. Isn't it natural that people would take photos when they visit a new place? And that too of gardens?

Jorasanko The House of the Tagores,sen1947,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,2-Feb-17,"Jorasanko was the ancestral home of the Tagores. Its main attraction is of course that the Noble Laureate Rabindranath Tagore was born here, lived here and died here. Some of his most critical works were written here. The name Jorasanko is derived from the fact that there was a pair (jora) of small bridges (sanko) that led to the house. The house was built by Nilmoni Tagoe and was constantly modified and added to by the later occupants. The house that we see today is the handiwork of Prince Dwarkanath Tagore the grandfather of Rabindranath. Dwarkanath had also built a Baithak khana or reception section where he entertained his English friends and acquaintances. Later this was the residence of two great painters of the Tagore family – Gaganendranath and Abanindranath who established the Bengal school of painting. Unfortunately for reasons not known Rabindranath’s son Rathindranath demolished the house. The Joransko was home not only to Rabindranath but also to his highly gifted brothers and sisters. His eldest brother Dwijendranath was a scholar, poet and music composer. His songs are still sung specially at Brahmo festivals. Satyendranth was the first Indian to join the Indian Civil Service. Jyoirindranath (always referred to as Jyoti da by Rabindranath) was a poet, dramatist and composer of many songs and a music composer. He had great influence on Rabindranath in his formative years.

On entering the house there is a large courtyard where the Major Brahmo festival was held on the 11th day of Magh, corresponding to 25th January. Large number of people assembled here to listen to the sermons and songs of Rabindranath himself. The songs were sung by family members initially and in later years Rabindranath brought down the singers from his school in Santiniketan. 
On one side of the main building is the entrance to the upper floors that has now been converted into a museum. The entrance fee is Rs 10 for Indians and Rs 50 for foreigners. The rooms display photos and furniture. The visitor can see the room where Rabindranath died, the room where he was born and the room where his wife Mrinalini Devi died. There are also rooms related to the visits to different countries by Rabindranath as well as paintings of Gaganendranath and Abanindranath. 
Undoubtedly a great work of restoration has been done in the recent past. I recollect the great depredation that had taken place of the building through years of neglect. 
However some of the places are still out of bound. The rooms where Kadambari devi (the sister in law of Rabindranath lived and committed suicide) is not open to the public. Kadambari Devi ( whom Tagore always referred to as Nutan Bouthan) had a lasting influence on Rabindranath – both in his songs, poems and paintings. 
Unfortunately no photos are allowed inside the museum. Nor can photos be taken of the outside from the museum. 
The museum centres mainly on Rabindranath but not much is mentioned about the great family that resided here and was the leading light of the Bengal Renaissance in 19th century. 
One of the major attractions not known to many are the functions held on 11th of Magh the foundation day of the Brahmo Samaj in the Courtyard, thus continuing the tradition of the Tagore Family. More",Jan-17

One would have thought it would be more of a tourist attraction than it is but the fact is that it is very difficult to find information on it online. The place is easily walkable from Sovabazar Metro station and charges about a dollar for entry. They are ridiculously pedantic about cameras though and you are not allowed to take any pictures at all within the complex, the reason for which, apart from abject stupidity, is not clear. They are also very insistent on following a specified route through the house and will get upset if you don't. 
The museum itself is interesting in parts and monotonous in others. There is a lot of eulogising. There are whole rooms dedicated to the writer's short tours overseas but not enough information on his works to generate interest in a foreign tourist.

Possibly the most well-maintained museum in Kolkata,Deepanjan B,Pune,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,4-Jan-16,An absolute must-visit for Tagore followers. The respect and adoration for the poet clearly shows in the exhibits. The house itself personifies Kolkata culture ..... an oasis of peace amidst all the hustle & bustle. Photography allowed only on the grounds. Shoes have to be taken off to enter the museum and doesn't do your soles and socks any good. Filthy toilet - we had to use it out of desperation.,Dec-15

Don't think I'd return. It's surely very nice and the structure is very interesting. I think I personally liked it more than the others as I had read some of Tagore's poems and stories, many based in this house so I could connect things but someone who knows a little or nothing about Tagore I wonder whether they would appreciate the place at all!",Apr-15
Plan for a visit with your kids,Joydeep_Mondal,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,18-Dec-15,"I initially had planned for a 2 hours visit, but it turned out that this place have more to offer. The place shows the various life time period of the great personality who had made a mark with his work not only in Bengal but the world around. 

The vastness is immense and there are lot to see and learn about this great personality. 

If you have kids this place can definitely be a great place to visit to give them a taste of actual bengali culture (we now a days are bombarded with global culture not western in specific and somewhere we are struggling to keep our own). 

Overall, it's a great place in the middle of the bustling north kolkata and a great experience overall. 

Note: 
1. If you are going with a DSLR, you will be asked to keep it in the administrative office locker and then will be given the key. 
2. There is a fee of 10 INR for indian national and i think 50 INR for foreign national. 
3. Bring some water bottle with you as once you come out they might not let you get in. 
4. No good restaurant or food court I found nearby this place. So plan accordingly.

When I went there, I realized how culturally rich the Tagore family was in their time. Not only Rabindranath Togore, but paintings, beds, clothes, medals of other prominent members of the family has been preserved for public display. Painting of Rabindranath Tagore are at display in Vichitra Bhawan. You can learn a lot about his travels (there is a separate Japanese and Chinese section devoted to his travels in the two countries), prominent scholars of those time with whom he was close to, and of course his poems.

The home is also a beautiful reminder of Kolkata's rich, majestic history. A must visit for all. However, do expect to spend atleast 2 hours here - the house is HUGE! 

I do not know if they offer tour guides - there was a foreign group that did and we tagged along and learned little tid bits that were not mentioned in the description of the rooms. Also, there is a gallery but its entirely in Bengali so that would be impossible for non Begalis to appreciate. Therefore to truly understand the man, his ancestry and his legacy I would recommend a guided tour. 

Another tip: You are not allowed to enter the home with your shoes or take photographs. There are lockers but best not to carry much. More",May-15

It is the home of Tagore in his early childhood and it will give you the feel of his life and times. The display galleries are extremely interesting and well chronicled. History is presented in the form of writings, paintings, Gurudev's articles, photographs in the rooms that were once a part of Tagore's legendary family. 
There are some air-conditioned rooms too displaying Tagore's connection to various parts of the world like China and Japan. One can spend an entire day here going around the galleries. 
The fees is minimum but one is not allowed to carry any phones or bags inside. There are lockers to keep your belongings while you are visiting. 
The only shortcoming of this place is that some of the displays are described only in Bengali which is Tagore's mother-tongue without any English translation. So one might miss out on some parts if you are unable to read the script.

The ancestral home of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore is a typical traditional bengali home with a rectangular courtyard in the center and verandahs on all the 4 sides. The Thakurbari has a good collection of photos and paintings- most prominently of Ravindranath Tagore and his uncle - the great painter Abarindranath Tagore along with framed excerpts of Tagore's poems all over the house. There are also charts explaining the family tree and describing the achievements of the family members. Its impossible to believe that a single family can have such a vast pool of talent. The Thakurbari was undoubtedly, the nerve center of Bengal's rich tradition of art and culture and its members have given our land progressive ideas, ideals and thought. The Thakurbari also has a few newly opened galleries apropos the cultural exchanges between Indian and China and India and Japan. The entire place is very well maintained and has a flavour of serenity and calmness to it -- just as one would expect Gurudev Tagore's home to have. Certainly worth a visit.

Thakur Bari can be approached from Chittaranjan Avenue and Chitpur Road. If you wish to see the decadence of zamindari (rich land lords) era of Bengal, enter from Chitpur Road. The road is narrow and you can ride the tram car that labors its way through the congested road to Jorasanko Thakur Bari. 

The house is still maintained to an extent and you can see the room where Tagore was born, known as the 'antur ghar' and the large room where he breathed his last.

Disappointing ... and a Bit Tense,Meredith M,"Paris, France",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,27-Feb-19,"The Mother House has an incredible legacy, but visiting does not lend itself to the generous work of the past.

Great chance to learn more about this saint woman!,mtamayoo,"Madrid, Spain",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,22-Feb-19,"Most adults have heard about Mother Theresa. Her works and life can be better appreciated in this place, that the nuns and volunteers run so nicely. 

Being in front of her remainings resting place brought me so much peace. 

There are many ways to help the sisters to continue this huge task as they are present in many countries, but in Kolkata alone you can feel the need of the people when you walk the streets. This is a city where there seems to be no investment from the authorities. It's not that you visit the slums, it's like the slums are present everywhere. 

Mother Theresa example made me feel worried about this people and their wellness in a city that apparently does not care about health basics for their inhabitants... SO MUCH TO BE DONE! More",Feb-19

We chose Daya Dan for kids 4 years old and above with disabilities. We have done simple things like make beds with clean sheets, hung wet clothes, talk/ draw/dance/walk/read with the girls, fed paraplegic girls and do some Christmas decorations. The sisters are super nice and the ladies that work at the House are very nice and kind. Everything is spotless clean and the kids are very well taken care off, so makes it a very easy first volunteering experience. My daughter is 14 years old and is enjoying very much.

She was an extraordinary human being and the Sisters who now run Mother House are as well. Kind, receptive, patient. I visited this house when I was seventeen years old. It has not changed much over the decades. Still clean. simple and quietly conducive to prayer and meditation. Makes you think about your own life and whether you are wasting it.

Fittingly Sparse and Simple,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,30-Nov-18,I am going to leave aside my feelings about Mother Teresa (complex legacy) and just focus on the place. This is a very simple and sparse convent basically. It looks like a budget apartment complex. There is a small museum with lots of objects from Mother's life. Her tomb is in a small basic room where mass seems to also be held. It is fittingly simple and plain as well. Pictures can ONLY be taken on the tomb itself nothing else.

Sentimental place,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,27-Nov-18,"Very sober place but packed with sentiment and meaning. Mother Theresa's personal stuff is on display and extremely nice persons in there.

Epitome of Simplicity,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,10-Nov-18,"Hailing from Kerala and being a devout catholic I expected this place to be teeming with visitors and to be crowded with all sorts of activities like offerings, burning candles etc. But what I saw there was a replica of the the quite and uneventful life led by the Saint herself. Though situated on the side of a busy street , the Mother House and the room of St. Mother Teresa is nestled between the building and except for a humble board there is nothing to announce its presence there. The tomb is a quite place where you can spend as much time as you want and there are no offerings or burning candles or any such exhibitions. Even though all visitors throng the museum in the adjacent room, still quiet prevails everywhere and it is a soothing experience to be here. More",Oct-18
A very moving place to visit.,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,10-Nov-18,This is located in a very poor part of Kolkata.

"OMG, so inspiring",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,9-Nov-18,"What a wonderful visitor centre. Do take the time to read the chapters of her life in large print displayed on the walls. Her simple bedroom, in its original state was jaw dropping with its bare furnishings. Her tomb is located indoors and it was remarkable to see the buses of nuns arriving to visit the Mother House on the Sunday we visited there and see them evidently in awe of St Teresa of Kolkata. We were present when a coffin was taken from the Mother House and everyone nearby respected the dead person and watched quietly as the simple coffin was driven away. What an amazing person St Teresa was on this earth, she had nothing but gave everything of herself. More",Oct-18
serene and informative,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,7-Nov-18,"Right from the entrance of Mother House, happy sisters with a warm welcome in their eyes and smile, a simple calm walk through the ground floor - the museum and mother's tomb and then the stairs up to mother's room, so feel good, feel so proud to know so much more about the journey of a simple girl who did simple things to change the world, single handedly.

Thank you Mother, Kolkata loves you.",May-18
Stirring and Humbling Place,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,6-Nov-18,"It really brings home the great works and humble nature of Mother Teresa.

It is a very quiet and contemplative place of peace in a very chaotic world.",Mar-18
Good work continues,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,5-Nov-18,"It is good to see the good work of Mother Teresa continuing here.

In her presence,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,3-Nov-18,"So nice of the Missionaries of Charity to allow visitors. I’m so glad I came. Even though they got a bit of a “cult of personality” thing going on here, I think visiting is a fitting way to honor a person and the organization she started who has done so much for the disenfranchised of India. When you go upstairs to see her simple bedroom, you can see a picture of Mother Teresa and Pope John Paul II in this same room. This was my favorite thing to see here.",Nov-18

Nice quick visit,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,21-Oct-18,"I'm not quite sure why this is the number one attraction in the city, but it is worth visiting if you have time. The museum is thankfully very concise. You have the tomb, her old room, and a small museum. It keeps things to the basics without expanding needlessly on stuff you'll forget later. This is a free visit and one that I would prioritize as a second tier attraction.",Oct-18
Not to be missed,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,16-Oct-18,"You can see the house and visit the tomb of Mother Teresa, whose charitable work changed the lives of thousands of Kolkata's poor. The Missionaries of Charity continue her work and keep this house well preserved for visitors.",Oct-18

The life of a very special person,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,14-Oct-18,"Easy to locate if you take a yellow taxi. Quite early but visitors at the Mother House, despite the torrential rain. You enter an outside courtyard then Mother Teresa's tomb is in room with an alter and seats for congregation adjacent. In the next room is a small ""museum"" to the history of her life. Some statements she has made in frames eg ""If people are worried about the future, it is because they are not doing enough in the present"". Also regarding the poor, ""Do not give them your pity and sympathy, give them your love and understanding"". Food for thought!! All she had in her room upstairs was a bed, desk, chair and little else. Ambulance outside adjoining hospital!! 
However, outside on the streets lots of people some tired, dusty, shoeless when will life be better!! Maybe too many people too few helpers!! How can we help?? More",Sep-18

Homage to Saint,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,5-Oct-18,As all say not a tourism place. But visit here is a must. The legacy still lives on. Dont miss out the Mother's room on the first floor. What a frugal bed and desk . True saint. Did not use a fan all her life . And only decoration was a potrait and idol of God. Pay homage at the burial place. Not very quiet. Too many people . But that's how she would have liked it. She was always admist her people. Photography of the premises allowed including the burial place. But not in musuem. Visit musuem to get a snapshot of her life.,Oct-18

If you are going there as a spiritual visit then I am sure you will enjoy the humble surroundings.,Sep-18

A quite contemplative place to visit.,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,15-Feb-18,"While Mother Teresa may no longer be with us, her charity is still very much continuing her good work and a visit here shows the simple lifestyle that she lived, despite being famous around the world. 
You can look into her room with its basic bed and wooden furniture, many with her fame and opportunities would have taken more opulent surroundings, this I feel shows the greatness of this lady and hence makes a visit a worth while pilgrimage. 
In a downstairs room lies her tomb, the surroundings are again simple, you can sit and look and think. Her room is up some stairs opposite across a courtyard. There a few other rooms to visit containing newspaper cuttings of Mother Teresa and other small memorabilia. Allow 30 mins max, but worth the visit undoubtedly. More",Jan-18

Visitors are only allowed to enter the chapel and the area near the tomb which is adjacent to the chapel. There is a small museum next to the chapel depicting the work of Saint Teresa of Calcutta.

Mother’s resting place and her work is preserved in a museum.

Awe inspiring humility,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,4-Jan-18,"As a must visit destination while in Kolkata, for a non religious person, I was frankly sceptical. The entrance sets the tone of this rather nondescript force...and I do use the word carefully; you distinctly feel a force there...a presence of humility, a very quiet power of accomplishment, a contentment of achieving something significant. 
I’m rambling, but that just shows how speechless I was in these surroundings ...I had met Mother Teresa (as she was known then), many years ago in Pune, and was held in awe then as a young doctor....so many years later, I’ve understood why. 
Just standing at the doorway of her humble room found me dumbstruck ...don’t really expect to understand all this...just go there! More",Jan-18

A historic stop,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,28-Nov-17,There is no cost to visit but your donations help the hospital near by. The history of her work was cool to see. Her room is also good to see. She walked the Christian path better than most.,Nov-17

Moving,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-Nov-17,"A must visit. The ability of the Mission's sisters to provide hope and reassurance to those so desperately in need, is one of the most moving examples of humanity I have ever seen.

In addition, the opportunity to see the tomb of Mother Teresa and her original living quarters.",Nov-17
Moving visit,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,17-Nov-17,"I guess that, along with the infamous 'Black Hole of Calcutta', Mother Teresa of Calcutta would be the most well known name associated with Kolkata. I was pleased to visit this quaint little museum and the tomb of the now-saint herself. The array of everyday belongings presented in quite a humble old-fashioned way demonstrate the love & respect which I believe many people hold for Mother Teresa. It's free (you can make a donation), doesn't take long, but worth it to mark in some way the impact one person can have on so many lives.",Nov-17

Visit - with the proper advance mindset,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,7-Nov-17,"My first visit here was in 1979 - the year Mother Teresa won the Nobel Prize. This was my first visit following her death, in 1997. The Sisters did a remarkable job of serenely carrying on with their work. I will comment in a nice/friendly way, however, that the excellent turn out of local tourists ignored the signs requesting silence & refraining from photography. Too bad! If you visit therefore - visit with the right mindset. This could be a serene and even a hallowed experience, but my visit today was simply to another “tourist spot.”",Nov-17
Moving experience for the soul,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,6-Nov-17,"You cannot leave Kolkata without visiting the house of Mother Teresa, a place where humbleness shines. It is also a good chance to make a contribution and help those who help others.",Oct-17

I spent around an hour on the premises. The room with her grave was peaceful and you do feel a sense of calm that runs through you the moment you enter. I spent a significant amount of time there with my thoughts and was definitely emotional. 

I then proceeded to view her bedroom which still contains most of her things.It is a humbling experience. 

Walking out of there I was happy and emotional. I would without a doubt visit the place again the next time I am in Kolkata. More",Dec-16

Nice calm place,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,27-Oct-17,"The Mother Teresa house is basically a house that has a few nuns who are taking care of thinga in there. 
The roon where Mother Teresa spent most of her time is small and very serene. 
No photography or videography allowed though. 
The nuns in the house are very nice and willing to spend time with you and answer any questions, they even warned us about some persons outside the house asking people for money and scamming them to believe that they actually work for the house!! 
Now, to talk about the missionaries of charity house which is basically an orphanage which is 5 minutes walk from the house. 
The house has a lot of nuns who take care of babies and toddlers. They welcome any volunteers or food that you bring to the kids, however, my only concern is that people bring chocolate and potato chips to the kids which the nuns accept and give to the kids as a snack, so please consider taking a healthy snack such as a fruit rather than sweets.

Interesting small museum and tomb,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,27-Oct-17,"Worth a short visit whatever your thoughts on her legacy. 
Simple tomb and small museum has info in English on her life and many artefacts. 
Some are fascinatingly banal like her medical equipment and waste paper basket!",Oct-17
Mother's tomb and documents,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,24-Oct-17,"No argument about her good works. As a visit, if you're not into the charity work, the museum is a bit weak and not worth a special trip. Lots of paperwork, some old photos and a marble tomb....",Oct-17
Different world,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Oct-17,It is a historic place associated with great humanity. I would rather others experience it rather than reading the review,Oct-17
I am not a fan of Mother Teresa,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,19-Oct-17,"I'm with Christopher Hitchens on the subject of Mother Teresa. Her organization rakes in the big bucks even after her death.

Excellent exhibition about St Teresa's life,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,6-Oct-17,"I had no expectations of this visit to the Missionaries of Charity. The convent carries on working much as it has done since 1953 when Mother Teresa moved in. She occupied the same room until her death in 1997 and this is is open to visitors - very moving to see the space that she worked in for all those years. No aircon or fan.

Must see!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,28-Sep-17,"What an amazing woman. The help and support that she gave the poor is awe-inspiring. She was such a humble person that even though she was in charge, she still cleaned the toilet each morning. Her room was simplistic and she slept above the kitchen and still didn't have a fan in her room. 

Such an amazing, sombre place. I really enjoyed reading about her life and what she achieved. She seemed like such a selfless, beautiful person. 

A must visit. You were pressured into giving a donation. Everything was calm and relaxed. There was even signs telling visitors not to feel pressured to remove their shoes. Such a difference to what I've experienced elsewhere in India. More",Sep-17

May her love continue to sustain through the good work being carried out by her followers.",Sep-17
Mother house,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,15-Sep-17,"Interesting to see an Albanian born woman become so profoundly attached to India and trying to do good to Indian poor people. Can one person change things? It seems so. 
What impresses most is that everything is clean and tidy. Maybe this is a good starting point for each of us, and a message to the people that madre Teresa di Calcutta loved so much. 
Amazing is that people coming here and praying confess that their prayers were listened. So her spirit is still working for the needy ones.",Sep-17

If you go on a sunday during prayers, you also get to participate which is a plus. If you can get special permission by speaking to the sister in charge, you should go to the children's ward, where you'll see how the sisters take care of children of all ages - both normal and specially abled/challenged. All in all a very humbling and awe inspiring experience. More",Dec-16

An absolute must-see if in Kolkata!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,27-Aug-17,"I didn't sleep last night. You see, we walked the streets of Kolkata. It’s been too easy for me to become immune to the ""hidden"" poverty of the World I share. The curtain was lifted for me last night – I walked a place where the tears of the dying and the tears of the searching met and, frankly, it broke me in a tsunami of guilt and realisation. I felt priviledged at grabbing the arm of a stumbling, rag-attired lady who smiled at me warmly through a toothless mouth as she weakly mumbled a ""thank you"" for stopping her falling. I stopped to wonder where the lady curled up in the corner of a street, whimpering, had come from. 70 years, I reconed, of life...ending like this...at the teenager lad with excrutiating burns who clearly endured agony, yet raised his hand as I passed in some sort of gratitude that I'd even graced him with a fleeting glance.

Smiles, hands, gazes...hopeless hope. I feel like I have released a single drop of time into the ocean of... I didn't sleep last night. You see, we walked the streets of Kolkata. 

It’s been too easy for me to become immune to the ""hidden"" poverty of the World I share. The curtain was lifted for me last night – I walked a place where the tears of the dying and the tears of the searching met and, frankly, it broke me in a tsunami of guilt and realisation.

In my bed last night I was innundated with flashing images of those snapshot moments. Smiles, hands, gazes...hopeless hope. 

I feel like I have released a single drop of time into the ocean of humanity. A drop of understanding; of purpose perhaps. I guess the ocean would be less without my drop but it's just too easy for me to now escape under the excuse of the ""big picture""; to do nothing because my drop was too small; too insignificant to make a difference. NO! Doing tiny things unconditionally with the greatest condition of all, love, brings purpose. 

I have met so many wonderful people during my short time here. I have been genuinelly considered some sort of extended family member. I am embraced with love. I leave with understanding and purpose. How long can I sustain this transition before being manipulated back into the delusion of my World? 

Whatever happens I am wealthier than I was 72 hours ago. Drunk on the fountain of experience. Far more valuable than my pretentious Klaus Kobec watch! The truth is I need these people far more than they need me.

The little room with pictures of her as a teenager till her death, the books archiving her letters, newspaper articles etc brings to life the work. Her love for Jesus and in everything to commit to Father God in prayer is a light to us who is now living in a clouded and busy world.

Powerful in its simplicity,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,2-May-17,I lived quiet close to Mother House so was able to go for morning mass.

Real sense of poignance,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Apr-17,I visited the Mother House first thing one morning. Although not officially open I was welcomed in by one the sisters.

A moving experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Apr-17,"A visit to Mother Theresa’s home and grave was unexpectedly moving for our family. You don’t have to be an adherent of her religion to be touched by her selflessness, dedicated service to others, and her wisdom. 

The government gave special permission to bury her body in her residence; thus now Mother Theresa’s home and grave have become a pilgrimage site. There is a life-size statue of her outside the home. 

There was a room of memorabilia, pictures, and quotations, and I copied down some of her sayings that I particularly liked: 

""God has not called me to be successful. He has called me to be faithful."" 
""We fear the future because we are wasting the today."" 
""Intense love does not measure; it just gives."" 
""Let us not use religion to divide us. In all the holy books we see how God calls us to love."" 

This was my favorite spot in Kolkata, and I highly recommend you visit it. More",Mar-17
Mother Teresa's Legacy,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Apr-17,This visit was so meaningful and a testament to a life well-lived for others.

"If in Kolkata, a must do...an eye opener!",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,18-Apr-17,"Everyone knows of the great work that Mother Teresa did in India but what left me awestruck was the same work and dedication continuing after she is gone, she has left a legacy. The nuns were taking care of the children with as much dedication and love as a mother would. It was not for the world to see, it was because they are truly dedicated. 
Must see here is also Mother's room, completely minimum required things in the room, its on top of the kitchen. I am sure it was extremely hot in her room again shows Mother's character always giving and uncomplaining. 
Teary eyed and humbled I returned to my world, hopefully a little improved. 
I think a must do for all, especially young children. More",Nov-16
"Solemn, Inspirational",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,17-Apr-17,"As the Mother herself, the Mother House is very inspirational. I went there early in the morning on a Sunday and the crowds hadn't taken it over. Photography is permitted in only a few places, but it's quite amazing to go through the displays. By the time I spent like an hour or so there, crowds were beginning to come in. So I recommend going in early if you want to have some peace there.",Mar-17
"Simple, Solemn, Serene Place.",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,16-Apr-17,"This was about the only thing I did in Kolkata as I was sick that day. 

But I left the Mother House feeling much better. 

There's not much to see here and you could miss the place amid the chaos of the street. But this living museum to Mother Teresa's life and impact made an impression on both my girlfriend and I who are both recovering Catholics/agnostic. 

We witnessed a small group of Muslim men who brought roses to her final resting place. I saw Argentinian Catholics wail here as well. It was really touching to see all of the people pay homage to our modern saint. 

Highlights were seeing a Noble Peace Prize for the first time and her office as it was left with the placate indicating that Mother was ""in"". 

Check out the non-affliliated gift shops nearby if you're not overly sensitive to Mother's image being totally exploited. More",Mar-17
Simplicity personified,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,16-Apr-17,"If you go to Kolkata you should not miss visiting Mother's House? . Tucked away in a small lane though one side faces the road , everything here personifies the life she lead . Her memorial is so simple, and only a few flowers are seen scattered on her grave . When we were there the priest was saying a mass in the small chapel just beside the memorial .Her room is tiny, Spartan, a small cot ,a bench , a table . Not even a fan to keep away the searing heat of Kolkata . We were truly humbled by the simplicity of this great lady .",Apr-17
Peaceful place for worship,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,14-Apr-17,"We arrived and was told that it was closed for mass and to return at 6pm, we asked if we could join in the prayers but they said there was not enough space yet we saw other Caucasian tourists were allowed in. We arrived at 545pm and the sister told us they were closed, only after a few words she let us in. They gave us an impression that they prefer Caucasian tourists with the same faith. We are Asian tourists who would like to pay respect to mother theresa even though we might not be from the same faith. Hope that they would be more open and welcoming to people like us to visit and pay respects. More",Apr-17
A must visit,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,11-Apr-17,I feel this is also a must visit for visitors to Kolkata. Very unassuming and quiet place. A tribute to Mother Terresa. Can offer and pray peacefully and pay respect to the Mother.,Apr-17

A Memorial befitting Mother Theresa ( Saint Theresa),,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,10-Apr-17,This was the home of Mother Theresa where she lived the last 50 or so years of her life.

We visited and made a donation and we were asked if we wanted to visit the children. We did and it brought tears to my eyes. It was so good seeing these children, many who could not walk being nursed and stimulated by volunteers and local ladies. They were well looked after, clean and being fed. Without donations this centre would not be able to function. If you are in Kolkata it is worth dropping in and making a donation - if you are donating in foreign currency you will need to take your passport.",Mar-17
The Tomb is 5 mins walk away from the Monastery,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,6-Apr-17,"The monastery of St. Theresa is the place we're they feed people who are hungry and give medicine to the sick for free. 

The monastery is not the place where you can see the tomb of St. Theresa. It's actually located on the other building like 5 mins walk to each other on the same street. 

The room of mother Theresa is sacred that your not allowed to take photos. Her tomb is situated on the ground floor inside the building, next to it a church set-up for their regular Catholic mass and beside is the museum where you can find most of the memorabilia of St. Theresa. 

It's free. No need to pay but they accept donations and in return they give you Photo of mother Theresa, a small image of her like a pendant and her prayer guide.

Highly recommended for a visit.",Mar-17

Good to finally see the place!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,25-Mar-17,"With its history and worldwide ""fame"", this place most likely features on many travellers / tourists ""must see"" list when they visit Kolkata! This certainly was the case for us. 

My mental images of the Mother had been formed out of grainy black and white TV pictures in the late 70s / 80s, with her surrounded by hordes of vulnerable and sick people, scenes of abject poverty glaring at me. 

So it is quite strange to happen upon the Mother's famed place and find it to be serene, quiet, and not heaving with people. Maybe, it was just the day we visited. 

It's an interesting place, spotlessly clean and definitely a landmark to visit. More",Mar-17
Very humbling experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,23-Mar-17,Lovely to see where all the great work continues to be done. A must go when in Kolkata. Such a humble establishment with nuns providing such excellent care to some very disadvantaged people,Feb-17
a pilgrimage for us,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,22-Mar-17,the wife insisted on going here to make a donation rather than give to beggars. I actually found the house as interesting as she did.

There is nothinh to see except the tomb of Mother Theresa and a museum dedicated for her. There is ofcourse a solemn experience for a pilgrims heart. They dont ask for a fee nor you will feel compeled to give donation. There are foreigners volunteering in the center. What I like the most is that the sisters gave us a pendant with an image of the mother and a booklet of her without asking anything. They just smiled to us while giving the free memorabilia.",Mar-17
House of 1000s blessings,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,20-Mar-17,Just by coming near Mother's house is a beautiful experiance . It has the power of blessings recieved from 100s and 1000s of soul who have been saved by Mother .,Mar-17

Her former room is kept in a very good condition - but there is not really much to see and pictures are prohibited here. However the complex is very well maintained and clean. One can visit her grave and the museum next to it. The museum shows a lot of stuff from her life, but is not very nicely presented. However, maybe this is on purpose to show the simple life of mother theresa. Interesting place to visit.",Mar-17
It was the experience of a lifetime!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Mar-17,"I cannot say enough about the experience of being at the Mother House. To see the place where Mother Teresa lived and worked, to meet the Sisters who follow her example and do the work she did, was one of the most profound experiences of my life. I don't even know where to begin to explain the impact this had on my view of the poor, of helping others, and so many other things. Most days that I was there, I was able to go to daily Mass at the Mother House. In the back of the room, there is a life sized statue of Mother Teresa. It is situated where she used to kneel on the floor of the chapel. She always knelt in the back, not in the front where one would expect. She bent almost to the floor as she prayed and meditated on the Word Of God. At the Mother House one may visit the room where Mother Teresa lived during her years after she founded the Missionaries of Charity. It is a very tiny room, yet she conducted all the business of the order from that tiny room. It consists of just a bed, hooks for her two blue and white habits, and boxes to sort the mail for all the various people (other Missionaries) that kept the order running smoothly Not only the sight of such a tiny room reminds one of her deep...

At the Mother House one may visit the room where Mother Teresa lived during her years after she founded the Missionaries of Charity. It is a very tiny room, yet she conducted all the business of the order from that tiny room. It consists of just a bed, hooks for her two blue and white habits, and boxes to sort the mail for all the various people (other Missionaries) that kept the order running smoothly Not only the sight of such a tiny room reminds one of her deep humility, the fact that in spite of the incredible heat and humidity she chose the room directly above the heat of the order's kitchen. 

In addition to the room where Mother Teresa slept, there is a room where an exhibit of her life and the history of the Missionaries of Charity may be viewed. It is an education in itself to learn how Mother Teresa managed to do all she did for the poorest of the poor in slums that were not only foreign speaking but had a deep mistrust of Christians. She was fearless. 

How to describe the rest of the Mother House? I was privileged to be able to volunteer a few days. After Mass, volunteers who have attended Mass gather in the volunteer room where breakfast may be eaten. Volunteers serve slices of plain bread, small bananas, and chai latte. II advise people who are going to volunteer to take a small jar of peanut butter and a plastic knife to spread the peanut butter onto the bread. I am diabetic and must have the protein for breakfast, and I knew ahead of time that I would need to supplement the breakfast with protein,. Volunteers must go through an orientation before serving at any of the Missionaries Of Charity homes. After they have done this, they can eat breakfast on their own and go directly to the home they will be working at. If one is so inclined, I highly recommend volunteering ,It's hard work, but very satisfying. I would go back again in a heart beat. 

Volunteering takes place every day except Thursdays, The people at the various homes depend on the volunteers who serve them for their meals, and other needs. More",Oct-16

An agnostics tears,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,29-Jan-17,"Mother Teresa has been the iconic definition of self-less service on behalf of some of the world's poorest and ignored. This 77 yr old agnostic's definition of 'Saint' regardless of the Church's hijacked approval. I touched her huge cement tomb/gravestone with tears of respect for the endless grinding service -- moment to moment, day after day -- during a long life portrayed by the museum's picture gallery from youth > death. I fleetingly compared her life's spartan bed and 'personals' to my 1st world self-indulgence, monumental selfishness and studied indifference. I have stood in some of the world's 'greatest' churches, mosques, synagogues and temples, but few humbled me more. If there is one, ""God..bless Mother Teresa."" More",Jan-17

It is a strange building, like a fortress from outside, with a small courtyard and an external staircase to her bedroom, one room with Mother Teresa tomb where they celebrate mass, a small room full of pictures like a small museum on her life. 
You will find yourself surrounded by sisters going around very busy and always smiling to everybody, you will be watching people praying on the tomb, you will be watching the pictures and reading the story of her life.... and you will be moved, you will feel something very strong inside you as I did and you would like to stay longer, you will not be able to thank the sister that at the door will give you a present to remember Mother Teresa because you will leave with a lump in your throat.

The vast amount of pictures, news clippings, write ups and general information on her life tells a story that was more incredible than I could ever have imagined. Her selfless desire to bring light to the forsaken was so intensely stirring to me it brought tears to my eyes.

We are called to love each other.,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,7-Jul-16,"What a visit! We have some many definitions of ""help"" when tragedy strikes - we send thoughts and prayers, we donate some money, we have opinions, we discuss and debate the right thing to do through petitions and more. But Mother Teresa provides a living example of what it really means to help one other and why sacrificial giving is needed. 

Mother House is broken into 3 main areas - her tomb, the room where she lived and the museum chronicling her life. For me, the museum lit a very bright light to help explain how we need to help each other. Her letters, the pictures, her quotes, her description of the plea for help from Jesus and her world map with her markers where Missionaries of Charity had set up are all testaments of love. What a love! 
That's the love I want in my heart for those in need. 

Wow. I will never be a Mother Teresa, but I can and will definitely do more more to help. There are too many people dying in the streets who can be saved with a few dollars. There are too many people living in a bubble consciously living in ignorance of their plight. She makes it obvious why there's no real sacrifice in sacrificial giving.<3 More",Jul-16

There were some Sisters of the Order around and they were friendly. Mother's tomb is in the middle of the hall. It was her wish to rest in her own Home instead of the great St. Paul's Cathedral. 

When Mother Teresa was asked whether she was the chosen servant of God, she replied that she was far less than that. She was His pencil and it is not a good one, needs to sharpen constantly. Thank you, Mother. More",Dec-15

A place to reflect and admire,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,7-Mar-16,"Meeting Mother Teresa's fellow nuns is a peaceful, interesting and learning activity in noisy Kolkata. Then the privilege of seeing her old room and belongings as well as the exhibition of her lifework is inspiring. We were lucky to assist at a mass alongside her tomb which was very moving. A really good visit and don't forget to take the nuns your medecine that you were lucky enough not to need on your travels.",Feb-16
VERY MOVING,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,5-Mar-16,A very moving experience to see where the Mother lived and worked together with her tomb. Free entrance but no photos and the Sisters are very helpful.,Feb-16

Go in admiration to Mother Theresa but expect nothing,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,3-Mar-16,"To set the stage: I am not very spiritual. If I was, maybe I would have gotten more out of the time spent at Mother House. It's basically a straightforward Kolkata building, and a very large room houses her sarcophagus. I was impressed by the people from all over the world who were praying in the room. 

I would have liked to see things that gave me insight into her work and that of the nuns who are carrying on, but unfortunately did not see anything. Abject poverty is all around you in Kolkata, and having some exhibit there of the group's work and needs would have made such a helpful impact, I think, in instigating the visitors to making some positive contributions. I also really, really would have liked to donate money, but also saw no option for it. 

I.e, I came to Mother House from an expectation of seeing and learning, and there was nothing for me. But if your expectations are simply to be in the presence of Mother Theresa's remains, in a respectful atmosphere, then you will find what you wish for. More",Feb-16
Peaceful,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,3-Mar-16,"If you are in kolkata, it is a place one must visit at least once. You can see the room mother Teresa used to stay and the place is filled with mothers who are actually taking care of the sick.",Mar-16
"Meaningful,",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,3-Mar-16,"Everyone knows of the great work Mother Teresa did for the poor, needy and sick from the late '40s onwards. The MCs who were at Mother House conveyed a beautiful feeling of peace even though surrounded by tourists climbing the steps to see into the small room that Mother Teresa lived in and to walk around her tomb. Her spirit obviously remains there and it felt quite meaningful to have visited.",Feb-16

It's a once in a lifetime opportunity, and if you find yourself in India, I would highly recommend this as a thing to do one morning.",Mar-16

Awesome,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,23-Feb-16,"Visiting the House of Mother Teresa was a wonderful experience. Came away feeling calm and wanting to do so much! 
The history and story is laid out very well and lucidly in the lower chambers where we can walk in organised fashion. There are groups visiting the grave of The Mother daily. There is one day it is shut, though not sure when. 
Her Room, so simple, above the kitchen.. what struck me that besides the stark simplicity, there was no fan. Then I read on a placard on the side.. it was written, though her room was over the kitchen, and at times it got really really hot, she refused to keep a fan in her room. 
Amazing woman.. so humbling the experience! More",Feb-16
A Gift in The city,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,23-Feb-16,"I visited Mother House. It was very peaceful. When I arrived many volunteers had been in Mass with the Sisters. I was welcomed into the quiet courtyard. Mother Theresa's resting place is spacious, and has room for anyone wanting to sit , reflect and pay their respects to an amazing women, and nun. The novice nuns move quietly about and any questions are to be asked quietly to a sister. 
I was there to volunteer so it was a very humbling experience. Many young and old 
were there to give their time in the various areas where volunteers were needed. 
It is well worth visiting but my volunteering experience has given me the confidence 
to go further afield into India and Nepal. More",Feb-16

A really spiritual experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-Feb-16,A visit to the Mother House should be one of the main reasons that you visit Calcutta. It is a very humbling and at the same time uplifting experience. Even if you are not religious it really makes you think and appreciate the amazing work that Mother Theresa did and that the Order continues to undertake. Just be aware of the 'unofficial' guides who lead you to the House and the pester you for money when you leave. There is a notice inside advising you not to give money to these people.,Nov-15
Calm and simple place,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,20-Feb-16,"Located in central Kolkata ..... You are supposed to take photos of Mother's tomb only.

Visit now before Sainthood,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,25-Jan-16,"By far the best part is the mini museum for all things Mother Teresa and her work to establish her order. Very interesting this should take you about 2 hours to go through through all. The cell where she lived is located on a upper level so be prepared to walk up a flight of steep stairs while the museum and burial place are on the ground floor. Beware when you arrive there will be peddlers saying they are tour guides for the house and that they require money, but Mother's house has no tour guides and you can do this on your own, so make sure not to give anyone any money. This is a place for reflection so turn off your phone and be quite. This is still a working nunnery. You must go before she becomes a Saint and this tiny place get's more attention which means more people and this place is very small to begin with. Also in the room where her tomb is near the entrance there is a spot to leave a donation and a spot where you can take some of the flowers that the sisters remove from her tomb each night.

Volunteer,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,2-Jan-16,"A supreme Calcutta experience, a day volunteering at Morher House starts with a six am mass with the humble sister of the mission of Charity. After a breakfast of banana, a roll and some hot tea, you head to your chosen house. There are several to choose from from the orphanage, to neurologically challenged kids, to the dying and destitute. You start with washing all the laundry in big tubs BY hand. The gowns and bed linen for each cot gets cleaned and then hung out to dry. Then it's time to meet the people. I was in the home of the dying and we were able to bring some comfort by rubbing oil and massaging some tense and dry hands, arms. And backs. The human touch and service were all part of mother Theresas plan in which the one serving is being as ministered to as those being served. These very poor and quite twisted bodies so near to death, responded gratefully to human touch. We fed them lunch of rice and fish, helped them to the bathroom and tucked them in their cots for an afternoon nap. It was so special being able to serve and meet so many wonderful humans from all over the map. My heart was very full and I would recommend it as a special experience for any Kolkata traveler.

Peaceful!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,25-Dec-15,"In the hustle and bustle of Kolkata, Mother House is really the best place to feel the peace in your mind. It is very tranquil here, and I felt that I was welcome here all the time. There were also rooms dedicating to the life of the Mother where I had great insight in her life. Just one reminder, I remember there was an old woman at the gate asking for help because her child was in hospital (I didn't know if this was true). She asked some for help (not only me). I agreed to help. It was nice when she said that pls buy milk, don't give me money, but then the milk cost Rs. 500, quite a big amount for me already (she did not seem really nice when I said that I dont think I have enough money); then I offered to give her some money so that when she had enough, she could buy milk for her child. I dont know if what she told me was true, but hope that she was sincere. 
But this place is definitely to visit in Kolkata! :) More",Jul-15

I thought it was such a lovely walk through and the visit gave me a deeper understanding to who Mother Teresa was. Loved my visit tremendously and would highly recommend it to anyone who is in the area. I've heard that most people would actually spend some time volunteering at the House. I didn't do this due to my short time in Kolkata -- but would have loved the experience.

Place that makes us humble,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,30-Nov-15,"The mother (Teresa) house hosts a prayer hall (which also has the tomb of the mother ), the room where Mother lived and breathed last and most importantly a small museum covering Mother's life. Knowing the simple life Mother has lived ( her room just had a cot, a small almara and a few letter boxes - not even a fan ) while touching so many lives was a heart touching experience. When going through the museum, I was forced to ""understand"" the magnitude of sacrifice - a young charming beautiful girl through her sheer determination and belief has done. An extraordinary source of inspiration for anyone who aspire to great things in life. More",Nov-15

Deeply touched by her story and her life,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Nov-15,"Decided to take a morning walk before having breakfast at the hotel. It turned out to be a good and peaceful start of the trip. After walking through the filthy and crowded streets of Kolkata lined with homeless and tired-looking people, and strolling past a cemetery full of great tombs of men and women who once lived here, we spent a quiet reflective time at Mother Teresa house and paid respect to her tomb. 

It seems an apt journey to arrive at the house of a woman who worked tirelessly to lift up the life and spirits of the poor. The contrast of the humongous looking tombs in the cemetery with the simple room of Mother Teresa also reminded me what is important in life. 

Feeling deeply touched by her story and her life. More",Nov-15
Only for the fans,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,19-Nov-15,"I thought I would see the work and selflessness of this order on this visit, how wrong I was. 
This is not much more a tribute to Mother Teresa and very little else. I saw selected photographs, video clips and heard commentary of the work but it seemed too far removed from the the actual work that is done. 
I found the visit a rather sanitised promotion of a starring character and very little of the work done by the sisters was either displayed or evident. 
Being taken to this place was really visiting a shrine rather than being able to further understand and witness the selfless work the order is known for. 
I feel that more would have been achieved and understood by perhaps a visit to one of their clinics or hospitals rather than just basking in the fame of the founder. Furthermore hearing one of the sister brusquely admonishing a visitor for taking his shoes off to enter the tomb room was very culturally insensitive. More",Nov-15
Great Life with Great Meaning,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Nov-15,"Home of Revered Mother Teresa,this place is pilgrimage rather than sight-seeing spot,like Birthplace of Swami Vivekanand and Dakshineshwar.

“A humbling experience”,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,15-Nov-15,"Almost as soon as you enter the Mother House, peace and tranquillity descend. The museum really shares a very special part of Mother Teresa’s life. Her bedroom will reflect the sparse simple way of a MT Sister. Showing you the simplistic pure way of life that these beautiful sisters live and how much their vow of poverty means to them.

Wonderful Woman,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,17-Sep-15,"It is thrilling to tread in the steps of a real Saint. While obviously an essential trip in any visit to Kolkata, we were truly awed by the significant memorabilia and the skerricks of her story that allowed some appreciation of the enormous difficulties faced and overcome by this dedicated lady. As always at such places, seeing her cramped bedroom/office was a levelling experience. How did she do so much with so little?",Feb-15
Peaceful!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,15-Sep-15,"Leaving our shoes outside we went into the hall on the ground floor. It featured the life and achievements of Mother Teresa and lots of other information.

"Inspiring visit ""The Mother house""",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,5-Sep-15,"I was damn lucky to visit Mother house during my recent visit to kolkata. We were earlier planning to visit on 27th August along with other places of interest. However, somehow our plan got changed and we visited Mother house on 26th Aug. To our surprise, this was a very good decision as it was 105th birth anniversary. The house was decorated and whole ambience was magical. It is such an inspirational place. We also came to know later that the house is closed on Thursday, which was our earlier plan. Extremely lucky to visit Mother house.",Aug-15
Mother house - Inspirational,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,4-Sep-15,"Visit of this place increased my respect to Mother Teresa. Her bed room, diaries, letters, dress, sandals all are displayed. She lived in a small room and slept on a wooden cot with all simplicity. She came and blessed thousands of street children in Calcuta through her dedicated charity work. We can see tomb of mother in a silent peaceful room. I wanted to donate to their charity but unlike other places there is no receipt book or office to receive money. Sisters there politely told me that there is a small box in the tomb room where I can put the offerings. This charity is different.",Apr-15

Meet the Masses,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,20-Aug-15,"Attend the 4:30PM Mass on Friday. Very hard to understand the English and a Nun yelled at me for stepping out of the building entirely to make a phone call. Great to see a place of interest where such a historical figure lived. Museum was loaded with artifacts. Very clean washroom it was actually one of the three places in the country that I saw that had an American Toilet. Received a Mother Teresa Medal and information when leaving. DO NOT talk to the people outside as they're professional beggars. One woman would not get out of the doorway of the taxi when trying to leave as she said ""I didn't give her anything yet"". Gave her a coin and that wasn't good enough. Apparently beggars can be choosers. Choose to stay away and only visit this place if you plan on attending Mass. I'm Catholic and the attitude of the nuns was kind of rude. The ability to say you attended a Mass at Mother Teresa's house makes it worthwhile. Bring water as you'll thank a higher power that you have it. Very hot in there even though they have lots of ceiling fans. More",Aug-15
A must visit,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,17-Aug-15,This one puts Kolkata on the global map. One of the famous places of Kolkata. One must visit to understand the simplicity of life.

""" Heaven on earth """,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,13-Aug-15,"It is one my best experience as a grown up man. The place is an epitome of kindness, sacrifice and in real sense to learn about a person, what mercy is all about in real sense. 

The place is home of the real immortal goddess, as no words could describe "" MOTHER TERESA "" she was a power above all, her devotion to help the poor, diseased and the unprivileged was something we don't see in living mortal. 

I was in tears and moved all over, when you see her life work, her living place. And her Tomb. I feel there is a sense of silence and peace and every moving and living human in that campus, represents her. Words are not enough how great is that place.

I would recommend every visitor to Kolkata to visit the site, regardless of religious belief (or non-belief). It gives you an insight to the life and works of Mother Teresa. There are many visitors but the visits are organized and the sisters very helpful. Donations are accepted but one is not pressured in any way to contribute anything. One tip: you need to avoid individuals selling you their guiding services outside of the building. It is not discouraged, can be inconvenient and is absolutely unnecessary.",Apr-15

Loved this. Serene. I suggest a donation for their work.,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,15-Jul-15,"Teenaged daughter and I visited here just for about an hour. It was too short, but we wanted to move along to the other attraction that morning. We just took a taxi from our hotel here. I suggest bringing the address to show your taxi driver, though for this particular attraction, Mother House, our driver knew where it was. It was very interesting to see where Mother Teresa lived. It appears to be a residence of private rooms, three stories high, around a central courtyard. Pictures are permitted at the tomb and chapel, but not around the nuns' rooms and courtyard. Mother Teresa's room has been kept as it was, with a plaque of information that you can read. You will see the sisters in their saris walking around, and a water pump in the courtyard where they wash their saris (we watched one). I enjoyed the serenity here. If bringing a donation, a person can give it to the sisters in the chapel, or ask to see a different sister for a receipt. We waited a little bit and met with a sister in an office, and were given a receipt as a cool treasure from Mother House. This is the place that accepts volunteer applications on Wednesdays at 3 pm.

Pride of the City of Joy,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,25-Jun-15,"Mother House, in my personal opinion, makes us all take great pride to boast claiming the Holy Mother spending her blissful time here, rightly followed by the recently-deceased Sister (Mother) Nirmala. I feel honoured to call myself a Kolkatan, primarily due to Mother House's existence in my heart, as well as the Heart of the City. I was spellbound during my recent trip there, and felt like I have wasted my life on work and other materialistic aspects of life, whereas the sisters (headed by the Mothers) sacrifice everything for common cause of the poor and the needy. Kudos to all.",Jun-15
Unexpected Visit,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,25-Jun-15,"We stopped here unexpectedly and was pleasantly surprised. There was an interesting little museum with her artifacts, writings, and newspaper clippings. We were able to view her room, and see her tomb. It is worth the stop.",Jun-15
TOMB OF THE POOR,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,23-Jun-15,"A must see place in Kolkotta - mother house - Mother of poorest of poor in Kolkotta Street.

Anjeze Gonxhe Bojaxhiu more popularly known as Mother Teresa set up the Missionaries of Charity here in Kolkata for the poor to the poorest. Mother House is located in AJC Bose Road. If you are coming by Metro Railway, get down at Park Street Metro Station and then walk towards to the South Park Street and take left on AJC Bose Road and you will find the Mother House, mainly a museum and also the Missionaries of Charity, Nirmal Hridaya etc. Pay your tribute for the Lady who had given the selfishless love towards our society.

Peaceful and thought provoking,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,7-Jun-15,"We had no bother at all with the beggars and scam merchants who loiter around outside here (we didn't see any at all). This is a peaceful, very thought provoking place. I'd suggest going to the small museum first, and taking your time walking through, head to the left of the museum as you enter, and then follow the picture boards round. Then take a look at Mother's room at the top of the stairs and finally, pay your respects (removing your shoes) to Mother. 

While it's sad to read recently that Mother was questioning her faith for many years before her death, to me this makes the sacrifices that she gave so much greater, than in a time of personal crisis she continued to work on for the poor and the homeless. More",Mar-15

Gave me goosebumps,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,16-May-15,"I could feel Mother Teresa's presence in the Mother house, it was as if I expected the tiny figure to appear round the corner.

Place to remind us of humanity and service,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,11-May-15,"Just as a place its nothing..however to know how someone lived here had spent all her life for people of Calcutta is simply humbling.

Humbling,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,5-May-15,"A visit to this place is ""Not Glamorous"" but extremely humbling. It has a small museum that recreates the life and times of Mother Teressa.

The sister took me to Mother Teresa's tomb and even allowed me to see her room. Photographs cannot be taken anywhere except the tomb.

Must visit for the Tranquility and Peace,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,26-Apr-15,"A visit to Kolkata wouldn't have been complete without visiting Mother House. 

Locating the place was easy, almost everyone knows about it. The place is non-descript, you can walk right by it without noticing the significance or importance of it. 

A nun of the Missionaries of Charity greeted us as walked in and guided us on what we should do. The Museum which displays Mother's artifacts was awesome, her Nobel Peace Prize certificate/citation, her letters and photos, etc. were just fantastic to see/read. 

It was good to sit in the prayer hall and see others bowing their heads in reverence. 

Mother's room was sparcely furnished, clearly showed how much she cared for others first and not just her. 

Overall, a very good place to visit, if you respect Mother Teresa for whatever she did to this world when she was alive and for whatever the Missionaries of Charity are doing after she has gone. 

The visit should not take more than 2 hours. More",Apr-15
"Quick tour, helpful people",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,26-Apr-15,"We visited the place on a Thursday, when the museum is supposed to be generally closed (according to the information outside the house). People there were however kind to allow us in for few minutes as we had gone specially to visit. There is a museum and Mother Teresa's tomb that you can visit inside Mother's house. In the museum, there is also a file with Mother Teresa's speech for the Nobel Prize that she got. The place is clean, quite and peaceful.

Overwhelming experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,18-Apr-15,"I wasn't prepared for the sensations I experienced when I visited Mother Theresa's tomb and the Missionaries of Charity. The silence, the cleanliness, the sincerity of the convent nuns and workers made me feel humble and strange. We were kindly admitted ""out of hours"" - it was our mistake: we had misunderstood the visiting hours. I can't forget the message written somewhere near the entrance, about treating others as you would have them treat you. Not just words here. 

There is a sign asking visitors not to give gratuities to the ""guides"" outside. We put a donation in a box inside the complex.",Mar-15

While 'Missionaries of Charity House' or 'Mother Teresa' are now local landmarks, other places of reference include 'Jora Girja' (St. James Church) and 'Bamboo Villa' (Income Tax Office). Both are located opposite the Mother House. 
The Mother House is easily identifiable : a four-storeyed grey building with brown shuttered windows; a short walk from the corner of Ripon Street. Walk into the narrow lane running along the left side of the Motherhouse, to reach the main entrance.

Very moving,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,10-Apr-15,"I wasn't prepared for the sad stories I read here and it was very sad.

Mother's House,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,7-Apr-15,Mother did all her good work from here.She worked for humanity.The place reminds me of Mother which I liked the most .,Mar-15
Quite moving experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,31-Mar-15,We walked across the city to Mothers house. It is closed from 1 to 3 pm and on Wednesday but is free to enter. We were made very welcome by the sisters. Read all about Mother Teresa in the museum and saw the place were she lived and worked. A remarkable lady. We were allowed to view the tomb where she is buried which is quite moving. The sister gave us a pendant and small book as we left. Must go and see.,Feb-15
The House,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,30-Mar-15,"Situates in kolkata, the museum tells the story. Time to see and visit is set. I collected one souvenir, kept with myself as one good reminder. The house speaks a million tales and lives, truely. I referred to the website entirely ere visit.",
Dedicated to the poor of India (of which there are many),,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,27-Mar-15,The Mother House was founded by Mother Teresa in 1950 after the break-up of India following the exit of the Raj. It is a very small and modest building which houses her very plain grave in the midst of the bustle of Kolkata. There is a lot of her memorabilia there with many of her hand-written notes in which you can see the giving nature of the person. It is worth a short visit.,Feb-15
It you like a Saint who doesn't really deserve it!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,27-Mar-15,"OK. Let's start with the fact that I am a devout atheist. I however ventured to the Mother House through curiosity and intended no disrespect. Christopher Hitchens' 'Hell's Angel: Mother Theresa' is worth a view on YouTube before you go however. Arrive informed is my principle. Anyway. It was something special to see the nuns in their white with blue striped habits. Iconic in our times. What struck me most was the heaviness of the worship. This is India where religion is light and celebrated easily. Here was a Catholic Mission worshiping within closed doors with a dark tone. It doesn't belong. It's transported Europe. I bought a Mother Theresa pen at the shop outside just down the road (not affiliated). The other choices involved Playboy Bunnies. What a contrast. This place should be part of any trip to Kolkata due to its history. But, all it really is really is is a place where the west allows itself to feel OK about how it uses the underdeveloped nations to fuel its needs. It alleviates guilt and other negative emotions. But I really don't know if it is truly doing any good. But maybe I am wrong. I have been before. Decide for yourself. More",Mar-15

A moving experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,17-Mar-15,"I found it a very moving experience to see where Mother Theresa lived and worked. While most of us are familiar with many of her quotes I found i learnt a lot from the museum. I was moved to tears realising how much she sacrificed and the sincerity in which she did so. 
It was interesting to see that many people were visiting the house who were of different religions and it was encouraging to see how her life has inspired many. To see her bedroom and her simple lifestyle was humbling. I recommend everyone to take time to go and read the articles in the museum and come out inspired. More",Mar-15
A peaceful and very moving experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,16-Mar-15,"The moment you walk into this humble building, the spirit of giving back and sharing love is palpable. The Sisters cheerfully hand out photos of Mother Teresa and guide you to her simple tomb. Her sparsely decorated room on the second floor sets the tone for this very moving experience. We left thinking out loud of how we can help the needy on a daily basis ?",Mar-15
Feels like Mother is still there,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,13-Mar-15,It is a holy place. Mother's tomb is on the ground floor and the chapel on the first. Opposite this is the simple room in which Mother lived. You can actually piece together her austere and simple life. You can ask the nuns in attendance for a blessed medal of Mother that you can keep in your wallet always. A good time to visit is on Good Friday. People in silent prayer move about. There used to be a life size statue of Mother kneeling and praying in the chapel. I have seen Mother in that exact same position stooped in prayer and so that statue feels like she is really there. Neighbouring store sells a lot of memorabilia of Mother which you can pick up at economical rates. This is a must visit in Kolkata. More,Mar-15
"Peaceful, simple elegance",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,13-Mar-15,A visit to this simple house that is the center or helping so many people is a must. Her place of rest in simple white marble is simple and dignified just like the women herself. It is closed between 12:00-3:00 for lunch.,
Unexpected Finding But Very Worthy,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,10-Mar-15,Our main destination to Kolkata was to visit the only Chinatown in India. We found a brochure of interest places to visit in Kolkata which mentioned about Mother House. We were delighted about it since we heard so much about her and her wonderful work in helping people. The place made me feel peaceful. Had a chance to attend afternoon mass and morning gathering where volunteer and the lady who in charge to coordinate meet. After having chai tea and piece of bread or banana all volunteer are given assignment where and what to do. Visited the tomb and the room where she sleep. Very worthy to visit,Feb-15
One of a kind experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,10-Mar-15,"When in Kolkata, visit Mother House early in the morning to have a day pass to one of the charity houses in Kolkata.

Oasis of Peace,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,1-Mar-15,"We found Kolkata to be noisy, dirty and extremely harsh on our throats. The trip we made to Mother House was a high light. The moment you enter within the walls you can feel the calm, Love and peace here. There is a statue of Mother Teresa that invokes her essences to the point of bringing tears to my eyes. When entering the room that houses her tomb it almost takes your breath away, you just want to bow your head in reverence to her. 
As you leave the room, on the right hand side is a container with the flowers they removed from the tomb the day before and you can take a few with you, very special. 
Even in her final resting place, her energy is strongly felt. More",Jan-15

"Calm, serene and inspiring",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,27-Feb-15,"We visited the Mother House in mid February 2015 mainly to show my daughter who is about six and half years old. She had completed a module on Mother Teresa in a Value education classes so when we visited Kolkata, we wanted to show her the place where Mother lived and worked. 
The tomb is simple yet inspiring. 
It was great to see Mother's room where she spent her life and to know that there was no fan in that room inspite of it being above kitchen. The room is closed and there is a grill and net through which one can see the whole room. 

The exhibition about Mother Teresa's life and the articles used by her give us insight into her work and greatness. Articles like her shawl, stool on which she sat, press and media coverage... her passport and then her first Indian passport... all are well preserved. There is a Visitor's book to write comments and thoughts. 

There are timings and we were lucky to reach just on time, else would have to wait. Morning and afternoon sessions when it is open for visitors. Morning I think it is 8.30 am to 12.30 pm and Afternoon it is from 3 - 5 pm. Photography is allowed only in the tomb area and not anywhere else.

A Must Visit,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,18-Feb-15,For all travellers visiting Kolkata Mother Teresa's House is a must visit. Go to pay homage to the great soul who toiled selflessly for the poor.,Sep-14
The beauty of mother house is in the almost divine vibrations in the place,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,18-Feb-15,"Whether or not Mother Teresa has enamoured you,there is no denying her saintliness. To even begin to understand the extent if her work and selflessness , a visit toMother House is a must. You will come away feeling enriched at the least",Feb-15
Amazing place!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,17-Feb-15,"Visiting Mother House was quite an amazing experience. What took us by surprise was how unassuming the place was. Except for the small board, we would have missed the building and walked on ahead. The Sisters at the Mother House and neighboring orphanages were quite friendly and cheerful, inspite of their responsibilities. They made you feel welcome and answered all your questions with patience. A must visit for all, just to get a proper perspective in life and count your blessings in life.",Dec-14
Absolutely Humbling,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,15-Feb-15,"Had a chance to visit the Mother House and Mother Teresa's Tomb. It is in almost an alley. You come up on the Mother House from a very busy street. The first thing you see is all the nuns walking around and you go in. The first thing you encounter on the ground floor is here tomb. It is to your right when you first come in. You have to take you shoes off. But, standing there before her tomb, and seeing her picture on the wall, you question yourself and what have you done to help the world? It is almost a spiritual moment, a moment of serious introspection. I was humbled to say the least. Then you go across the walkway and up some stairs to her room. Oh my God, you see this woman truly lived a humble existence. The room is so small. Her bed was so small. It almost looked like a prison bunk (no disrespect, but rather to illustrate). But, the thing that struck me the most was there was still widespread poverty just outside the Mother House. It proved one person, despite giving every ounce of her being, and her nuns, could not overcome the monster of poverty. But, she was an angel that once walked the Earth and everyone should stop by and experience the Mother House in person. More",Oct-14
Extremely moving - simple and honest,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,14-Feb-15,"An oasis of calm in a crazy city. The Mother House describes Mother Teresa's life in the way that she lived: simple, bare, with no elaborations, but telling the whole truth. It is moving to stand in the convent where someone who is known throughout the world actually lived and worked in her selfless way for 50 years. 
My most memorable experience in Kolkata.",Feb-15
"Well worth the visit, even if you're not religious",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,13-Feb-15,"A little hard to find, so make sure you have the address written down to show the taxi driver. Be aware of the visiting times.",Feb-15
Peaceful and serene,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,13-Feb-15,Was such a holy place and could feel the good vibes around you. Nice little museum to browse and so many sisters around to talk to. Great order of nuns.,Feb-15
Interesting,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,12-Feb-15,"When my mother visited this place 25 years ago, there were dead people in body bags all over the place and dying&sick people all around. Now the building is quiet and clean and houses a little exhibition about Mother Theresa. You can also see her grave on the ground floor (photography allowed) and her room (photography not allowed). It's all free of charge. There is an altar next to her grave.",Feb-15
Get close to simplicity,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,10-Feb-15,"Houses a small museum with some of Mother Teresa's personal belongings and many of her quotes at various international peace conferences.

An Inspiring Place,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,9-Feb-15,"This is the place where Saint Theresa is buried. This also houses the museum and where sisters of the Missionary of Charity live and work.

Informative & Quick,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,9-Feb-15,"Not being a religious person, I spent about an hour at Mother's House. You can read about her devotion to the people of Kolkata, and all of the good she did, see her room and belongings, and see where she is entombed in this convent. Nothing was overly done as I would expect, but I think it is worth a quick trip. This is something good to do after other things have closed for the day as you can visit later in the evening.",Jan-15
A must visit in Kolkata.,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,5-Feb-15,"The Mother House of the Missionaries of Charity, located at 54A, A.J.C.

A small but good museum,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,4-Feb-15,"I am an atheist, but very interested in religions (professionally, too). And Mother Teresa even got a Nobel, so once you are in Kolkata, it's a must visit place. 

The museum is very informative, with newspaper cuttings and other documents, photos, and the Nobel Peace Prize itself. 

Unfortunately, I couldn't see Mother Teresa's room, it is closed on Thursdays. But I had a little chat with a Polish sister there. 

You can take photos of the tomb and her statue only.",Jan-15
A humbling experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,1-Feb-15,"For those who know about Mother Teresa, this is a must visit, akin to a pilgrimage. The most humbling experience was to see her room, how sparse and simple it was. As someone who has met the Mother personally, this was an inspiring visit.",Jan-15
Peace,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,1-Feb-15,"This is the only word that comes into the mind when visiting Mother House. Sitting in the room which is Mother's resting place, brings you great peace, a quietening of a restless mind, and the diminishing of pain in a heart that's hurting. 

If nowhere else, please do go to Mother House when you visit Calcutta.",Dec-14
The Place of Peace,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,30-Jan-15,"When I visited Kolkata, this place was in my top wish list to watch, when I reached it I felt my self so happy and my friend who is a more religious guy sits beside me and says this place has great Positive energy don't know this is not my religion or nothing.

If you love Mother Teresa - must see,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,29-Jan-15,"It was good for me to see where Mother Teresa worked and lived. Her Tomb is a place of pilgrimage. Many just sit in the chairs and contemplate. The museum was interesting with displays of her life before the convent and in Albania. Her room and it's simplicity is inspiring. 
The entrance is down an alley. Now that antibiotics can cure many of the diseases that killed many in years past, the work of the community is more as a homeless shelter where the people leave in the daytime and return in the evening. 

If you found this review helpful, please note below. I appreciate it when others also give this reminder. More",Jan-15

Amazing Place...,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,27-Jan-15,"You must go this place if you go to Kolkata! It is amazing to see what she had done. I’m not a Christian by religion, but really respected the work she has done to the community. 

The original place is hidden behind the main road and side alleyway entrance, but it was nice calm and cool when you get in. Some part of the building was under construction when I went there over an year ago – hope they all completed by now. 

Enjoy the place, you will feel something different when you come out!!",Feb-14
Humbling experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,27-Jan-15,"We visited Mother Teresa's house in Kolkata This is certainly humbling and soothing experience. place has her tomb, small room where her belongings have been preserved and has information about her life and the room where she lived for most part of her life. There are many other activities that are going around the place but visitors do not have access to it. 

It will take about 1 hours to view the entire place. They have opening and closing hours and hence please check before your visit. I would encourage early morning visit as during the day entire area gets crowded. 

Beware of beggars in surrounding area.",Jan-15
Enlightening,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,25-Jan-15,"I am not a religious person but visiting here definitely leaves you feeling something spiritual.

Unbeliveable place to see,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,22-Jan-15,"A place to witness and a must visit place during your visit to Kolkata, I want to share that I have visited earlier when Mother Teresa was alive and interacted with her regarding doing charitable medical service at her place at Lucknow, then I also received a beautiful affectionate letter from her, and every words has a great meaning , a great satisfaction to your heart, see your self how dedicated the staffs are there and doing their best for others whom we don't care",Aug-14
Peaceful and spiritual,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-Jan-15,"Although there is much noise outside the Mother House, inside is so peaceful. It was humbling to see all the wonderful work she did throughout her life with the poor and destitute people of India.

Great Experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-Jan-15,"I was here on a very warm day, sweated my way through the exhibits etc. Miserably uncomfortable, despite all the fans.

To pay my respect to her,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,15-Jan-15,"I bet everyone knows who is Mother Teresa for all her contribution to the world especially to the poor and abandon group. Although she has left us for 18 years but we all will remember by heart who she is.

It was not easy to find this place and we have stop few yellow cab and all of them don't know the location of this place even we shown the address. We get in a cab where the driver said he knows how to go to the place, but he lost. He has been asking other cab driver whenever we stop at traffic light, he even get down the cab and ask the location from traffic police and finally he sure his way and brought us to Mother House. The main attraction here is Mother's tomb, that's the first thing everyone do to pay their respect to Mother. The tomb is inside one of the big room and there are few row of chairs, there are few people sitting on the floor and enjoying the peaceful moment. It is kind of surprise that I have the peaceful feeling although I can hear the noisy car horns on the busy roads, the room is facing the main roads and there...

Another highlight here is the bedroom of Mother, the room is simple and very bright because of big windows. There is a table inside the room where Mother used to spend her time for writing and reading. You are not allow to take photo of the room. 

There is a small museum which I think its more like a gallery of Mother, good collection of photos and items which has been used by Mother and also good story/article about Mother and her works done. 

You can spend time to talk to sister here in order to know more about the volunteer works and history of Mother Teresa.

We were let in by a very pleasant nun. During the lunch period, you can only visit Mother Teresa's tomb. We were not able to return later, so we were pleased that we could spend a brief time reflecting on her life. So do try to get there 9-12 or 3-6.",Dec-14
A place for a reflexion,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,11-Jan-15,"It was not too easy to find the place, but I found it without asking any help. Although it is located in a rather busy area, it provides a space for prayer or reflexion. There is no fee to come in, and the nuns working there leave the visitor to have their own moment. I was all alone, except a brief moment when two nuns coming to have a short prayer. The place itself is nothing extraordinary for me, but her work to help those who are in need is indeed a good example to some of us. While strolling around the city, I see some (not to many) people who were in dire needs of help. Mother Teresa was one of those who came and helped them. I believe that she was not the only one, but she was the one who spoke up and set up good examples. While praying next to herm tomb, I felt humbled and encouraged to do more for those who are in needs. More",Nov-14
Quietly moving,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,9-Jan-15,"This is basically a small museum devoted to the life and works of Mother Teresa. It has nothing bad to say about her. When she was a teacher she was a great teacher, and so on. This may be true, but it's not exactly interesting. And you wonder whether it is really true that she never did anything bad, badly, or just averagely. But she did do great work, and devoted her life to doing it. The more you read the more impressive it is. And then you see other nuns still there, who presumably do similar work. A group of them were praying when I visited, which was a moving sight. Mother Teresa's tomb is here, too, so you can pay your respects. More",Jan-15
just like mother's house,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,6-Jan-15,"if you are aware of life of Sri Sarada Ma, then you would surely sense her presence there. The place is bit tricky to locate but with little help from local people you can still make it. Beautiful house in small lanes.",Dec-14
Blessed,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,6-Jan-15,"Not only did I visit Mother Theresa's house.. her room and the museum.. but also got to see the school where she taught before starting her Missionaries of Charity.. 
Thursday.. only her Samadhi is open for prayers..",Jan-15
Peaceful,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,5-Jan-15,"Very peaceful area, gets you to reflect on how much she did for others. Fantastic little museum of Mothers' life and her work. You can easily spend approximately an hour here. 

Note: Some guides will try to bring you to Mother Teresa's Children Home, saying that it is her home. Make sure you ask to go to her House instead, where her tomb is located.",Dec-14
Peaceful,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,5-Jan-15,"This place was so peaceful. After entering the front door, you won't hear the horn blowing sound. I still wonder why.

An inspirational exhibit and moving place!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,29-Dec-14,"Do not miss this site if you're in Calcutta!!! It was such a joy to be able to visit the Mother House.

A pilgramage,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,17-Dec-14,The story of Mother Theresa has fascinated the world for decades and for good reason. This is a simple homage to her mission and illustrates the graceful simplicity of the work done by the order.,Nov-14

Home to the homeless,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,14-Dec-14,"Located at the Park St - AJC Bose Road crossing (mallickbazar), this landmark building attracts visitors from all over the world to pay homage to the great nun, Mother Teresa, probably the best foreigners India has seen in its five thousand year old history. Sacrificing her life for the empowerment of poorest of the poor in every possible way, by founding her organisation, Missionaries of Charity, stands above everything else this land needed in its history of social imbalance and poverty ridden march towards a prominent developing nation. With her leaving this material world in the year 1997, we remember her life and work visiting this holy place, something we have seen outside any religious texts in real world. More",Dec-14
Humbling Experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,14-Dec-14,"I visited the mother house and was impressed/overwhelmed by the experience. It's a small tomb and museum, as one should expect as it is still the functional residency for many of the sisters. 

i didn't experience any of the 'hassle' of street children, beggars or 'guides' which I have seen reported in some other summaries. 

As you enter there is a small statue of Mother which gives a real indication of her diminutive stature, then you enter the central courtyard and the room where you find her simple classic tomb. It is a moving experience, irrespective of your religious inclination. While we were there a service was being held which shows that the mission is still focused on it's service vrs making Mother the focus. 

There is a small, yet impactful museum where you can learn about her live, conversion and dedication to the poor, firstly of kolkata and then the world. 

Finally up a flight of stairs that feels long and arduous when considering the frailty of Mother to the room where she lived for many years. A small and simple room above a kitchen with only the most necessary furniture. 

I would recommend this as a must see location if you have a couple of hours in Kolkata, it's importance and humbling experience is something to be experienced More",Dec-14
This is a thing we did...,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,13-Dec-14,"Meh... 

The nuns are nice. Its certainly a thing to see. We walked through the back streets to get there. Enjoyable walk. 

Westerners beware, there are women who hang around mothers house spotting tourists, pretending to be helpful then you get full fledged shake down for money, they're really pushy and they swarm you and yell at you. 

Most Everyone we meet in Kolkata is really friendly and just trying to say hi. Its encounters like this that make us skittish.",

A place of peace and serenity,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,26-Nov-14,"If the Mother House is to be ranked the No.1 attraction in Kolkata on tripadvisor it cannot be without reason. This sparsely crowded place should definitely be on your list of places to see if you are visiting Kolkata for the first time. 

Visiting the place where this Great Saint of our times lived and is buried is a blessing. Sadly while we were there was an Indian guy filming his wife and child with his video camera as if they were at Madam Tussauds wax museum, striking poses in front of the saintly statues, almost committing sacrilege at this holy place. Even foreigners who come here are seen praying at the place. It's a pity the Indian family didn't value the Saint or her holiness. Mother herself was not Indian by birth. 

Apart from the paraphernalia of Mother Teresa that is displayed in two rooms (that speak of her utter simplicity) it the peace and divine energy that permeates the place that will move you. A sister (Nun) there will give you a booklet and a medallion which she will say can help you in a variety of ways. Take them with a spirit of reverence. More",May-14

House of Mother Teresa,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,13-Nov-14,"Mother Teresa is the name remembering which my eyes are filled with tank full of tears over flow for that great, soft, kind hearted and divine soul. I have not seen Jesus except on cine-screen and TV serials and documentary films. He was the only man who toiled for the poor and suppressed masses who were under the rule of inhuman Brutes. The Bible and many Biblical stories have recorded his ventures and sacrifice for the sake of uplifting the suppressed ignorant lots. Even a demon would shed tears on reading the life history of Jesus, whom the people have heard though not seen. We can only visualise how the life was in his days. Yes he was a man, who came down from heaven to earth to take every one to heaven. The situation that prevailed in Jerusalem 2000 years ago was not the same in 20th century. Yet the poor and rich, haves and have-nots continue to exist disproportionately. The living condition in India though was not fully hopeless, was so atleast in some parts of it.

The living condition in India though was not fully hopeless, was so atleast in some parts of it. The rich dominating the poor continued and continuing in one form or the other inspite of the sincere efforts and service of many social reformers. The moving population to cities hoping to earn their daily bread increased. The rural population started settling down in towns and cities because of industrialisation and employment opportunities. Even the most backward and illiterates moved to cities to do some manual work and to survive. Many such could not afford to live in rented houses. So they started spending time by involving in some avocation or the other and sleep on foot paths and other public or unprotected places. Millions are following this method in advanced cities like Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Bangalore, Kolkata and other cities. 

The mere expression of Kolkata makes you recall your memory about visiting Howrah Bridge, Dakshineswar, Shanthinikethan and other world famous places on earth existing therein and attracting millions of visitors every year. However the fact remains that the so called developed Kolkata is the worst city when you visit the slum localities there, which are predominant. It is a well known fact that the erstwhile Calcutta and present Kolkata is the one among the most polluted cities in India. There were and are many slums, where the condition of living of the people is discouraging and many times inhuman. We can’t blame anyone or the government for this polluted environment in slums in the so called Metropolitan cities. Kolkata is also the loudest and poverty prevailing city. 

Nevertheless in the hub of several hardships and non-stop miserable life the city is filled with kindness. Mother Teresa’s name has become synonymous with love and compassion for the helpless lots. She is known throughout the world for her affectionate service with love. Though she was specifically branded as throughout the entire world Teresa of Calcutta, yet she remained Mother of all toiling masses in the world, with is an exception that she did much of her service in Kolkata. 

For a man dying of hunger or leprosy or neglected by the society, no caste or religion is important. He will not consider it at all. Because first he must survive then only all other decorative terminologies of caste religion would come on show and make him show busy. When he is given a helping hand he feels that god is helping him in one form or the other. If it was Mother he would consider and look upon her as his mother rather than an angel. In such circumstances neither the caste, colour nor religion have any place or face at all. 

Mother Teresa’s house is her holy abode which is now recognised as the “Motherhouse” in Kolkata. It is found at AJC Bose Road and walk along Mother Teresa Sarani (the road named after her) we get the Blessed Missions of Charity, Mother house. It can be identified by a small wooden name sign board and guarded by soldiers. It is a pilgrimage center for many like me who revered it so. There are number of volunteers. I found it extremely peaceful. There were already some more visitors when I was in there. 

On stepping into first entrance the corridor opens with a few potted plants and statues of Mary and Mother Teresa. Then go to the small chapel in the compound to see the last resting place of Mother. Mother Teresa’s tomb is housed inside with common facility. It is decorated with beautiful flowers of attractive colours. You will find few candles that shimmered in the dimly lit room. The photographs of Mother are kept around her tomb. A museum is there in the next room beside the chapel and tomb. It contains many possessions of Mother, like some garments and the sandals used for walking. We can also see the room where she lived for nearly 50 years. I couldn’t click because a sister told me that photography was not permitted inside of her room. It is a small room suitable to put a single bed, a desk and bench. The bed is a light metal frame topped with a thin mattress. There are table paired with a bench, a cross and wreath of thorns on the wall. That was all what I saw in her room. Surprisingly I came to know that when Mother died on 5.9. 1997 she was on that very bed, preserved in her room. Mother Teresa’s house in Kolkata is a memorable place to visit. It is kept open every day except Thursday. It is closed on Easter Sunday and the 26th of December. 

Mother Teresa said “I alone cannot change the world, but I can cast a stone across the waters to create many ripples,” which she did indeed and created many ripples throughout the world. Since her death, Mother Teresa has progressed rapidly along the steps towards sainthood. Thus currently she has reached the stage of having been beautified. 

Mother Teresa was first been recognised by the Indian government when she was awarded the Padma Shri in 1962 and the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding in 1969. In 1979, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, ""for work undertaken in the struggle to overcome poverty and distress, which also constitutes a threat to peace."" She refused the conventional ceremonial banquet given to laureates. On her request the award money of $192,000 funds was given to the poor in India. She said that earthly rewards were important only if they helped her to help the worlds needy. When she received the prize, a reporter asked her, ""What can we do to promote world peace?"" She answered ""Go home and love your family."" 

On the theme in Nobel Lecture, she said: ""Around the world, not only in the poor countries, but I found the poverty of the West so much more difficult to remove. When I pick up a person from the street, hungry, I give him a plate of rice, a piece of bread, I have satisfied. I have removed that hunger. But a person that is shut out, that feels unwanted, unloved, terrified, the person that has been thrown out from society—that poverty is so hurtable and so much, and I find that very difficult."" 

In 1962 she was the recipient of the Philippines-based Ramon Magsaysay Award for International Understanding, given for work in South or East Asia. Her fame came to be attributed in large part of the globe. By 1970s she had become an international celebrity. The 1969 documentary ‘Something Beautiful for God’, was filmed by Malcolm Muggeridge, who was undergoing a spiritual journey of his own at the time made the short film based on his book of the same title. 
By then the Catholic world began to credit her with publicly. In 1971, Paul VI awarded the first ‘Pope John XXIII Peace Prize’ to her, commending her for her work with the poor, display of Christian charity and efforts for peace. Later she was awarded the ‘Pacem in Terris’ Award in 1976. 

She received many awards in subsequent years, including India's highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna, in 1980. When she was at an advanced age, attempted to resign as Superior general of the order, the sisters were unanimous in re-electing her in 1990, when she was 80 years young. 
Mother Teresa was honoured by governments and civilian organisations. Recognising her ""for service to the community of Australia and humanity at large she was appointed as an honorary ‘Companion of the Order of Australia’ in 1982. The United Kingdom and the United States have repeatedly awarded her, culminating in the ‘Order of Merit ‘in 1983. 

Her official biography was written by an Indian civil servant, Navin Chawla, and published in 1992. Her Albanian homeland rewarded her with the ‘Golden Honour of the Nation in 1994’. U S had conferred honorary citizenship of the United States on 16.11.1996. She had many such honours and doctorates during and after her life time. 

On 28 .8. 2010, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of her birth, the government of India issued a special 5 Rupee coin. Here five rupee coins us significant because this was the sum she first arrived in India with. The then President of Indian republic Smt Pratibha Patil said ""Clad in a white sari with a blue border, she and the sisters of Missionaries of Charity became a symbol of hope to many – the aged, the destitute, the unemployed, the diseased, the terminally ill, and those abandoned by their families.” Indian Railways launched a new train, ""Mother Express"" from 26.8.2010 to mark her birth centenary. 

Nevertheless, apart from admirers, she had many critics too. Chatterjee blamed her for promoting a negative image of Calcutta, exaggerating the work done by her Mission, and misusing the funds and privileges at her disposal and the like. She was criticised for her view on suffering since she expressed that suffering would bring people closer to Jesus. 

She singled out abortion as ""the greatest destroyer of peace today. Because if a mother can kill her own child – what is left for me to kill you and you kill me – there is nothing between."" Teresa was criticised for using her celebrity status to promote the Church's moral teachings on abortion and contraception. Some Bengali critics accused Mother Teresa of exploiting or even fabricating the degraded image of Calcutta in order to win international fame.

Serene and Peaceful,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-May-14,Travellers need to be mindful of the opening times but my wife and I arrived at 3pm which was the next scheduled time for visitations. The house is off Banarjee Road and well sign-posted. The house itself is still active with sisters praying and living there but worth a visit to pay your respects to such a unique and humble lady.,May-14
Theresa the great,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,14-May-14,A moving experience to visit here. The small museum could be much larger I feel but so suited to the modest mother. The nmuns are very welcoming,Apr-14

Inspiring place to visit,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,9-May-14,"I arrived around 11:30 so I did not get to stay as long as I hoped due to their 12:00 till 3:00 closure every day. 

There is a small shrine near the entrance where one can pray, and the nuns will join you to hold hands in prayer on request. 

Mother Teresa's tomb may be visited, and there are benches around to sit on. There were always some nuns and visitors praying around the tomb. 

There is a room dedicated to telling the story of her life which was very interesting. 

You can visit her room and other areas, but I ran out of time before getting to them.",May-14
MT,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,7-May-14,It was an honor to visit MT's contributions to India. Don't miss going to the House of Destitute and Dying or her orphanages. I would say this was one of my most rewarding sites to visit throughout India.,Nov-13

Amazing to see,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,27-Apr-14,"Wonderful ans very spiritual place to see and how awesome to see Mother Teresa's tomb and her room, which has been kept in tact. . It is amazing how she lived there for all those years as it is right next to a minging, noisy main road full of pollution and litter. Her room was so hot and she never even had a fan. What an amazing woman she was! There is also a small museum of her few possessions and pictures of her life that is very moving to see. Kolkata is not a nice city to visit but this place is worth coming to. 

Just be careful of anybody stood outside acting like they work for the sisters. They do not! I had a woman acting like a guide and then asking me to buy milk for her babies (this was a scam that she had concocted with a nearby shop owner to get money out of well meaning westerners who left the Mother House full of Christian compassion). Please remember however that the Sisters are very vulnerable and they can not protect you so please don't put yourself or them in any awkward position. Just ignore the scammers outside, walk away and don't even acknowledge them. More",Apr-14
Great food,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,25-Apr-14,Great food and really nice people. More reasonably priced than the restaurants across the road. Worth a visit especially if you're staying at Beyond Resort or Namankala Resort.,

A place to makes one feel motivated and blessed,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,17-Mar-14,"A not so extraordinary place from outside but as you enter the building, you get a warmth and silent feeling. A visit to the tome of Mother Teresa to pay her a respect for all that she has done to the community, also spend some time reading her autobiography in a special room. Should everyone on this earth learn from her, I am sure this will be a peaceful world to live in. 

Visitors to take note, Thursday is closed to public. Also, do take note of the opening hours, if I am not mistaken, they are closed from 12.00pm to 3.00pm everyday. Check the visiting hours before going.",Mar-14

A House to see,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,10-Mar-14,"I loved that this place was in the middle of Calcutta, not hard to get there at all. I enjoyed visiting and seeing where she lived and served. Her room and the museum of her belongings was interesting but for me a tiny bit creepy, because they collected all of her items from little things to detailed, like her shoes, her piece of hair even. Other then that it was a very lovely visit!",Apr-13

Genuine Inspiration,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,15-Feb-14,"There is so much wisdom and inspiration to take from this place. Her tomb is a place that is decorated with flower petals. The entire room has a peacefulness about it. Being in the presence of so many nuns who are devoting their lives to God and to the poor was very moving. Seeing Mother's few personal effects was also a lesson in simplicity. In that way, this place reminded me of when I saw Gandhi's place in Delhi. 

I would agree with many others who have written here. A trip to Calcutta is not complete without a visit to this place. 

Be careful not to come on Thursdays. Mother Teresa's room is closed to the public on that day. 

Also, do not confuse this place with the St. Teresa's Church, also on AJC Bose Rd, but at number 94. More",Feb-14
Peaceful and Modest,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,9-Feb-14,"Peaceful atmosphere and very very friendly staff. They are more than happy to answer your questions about Mother Teresa and about the place in general. The 'timeline' complied for Mother Teresa's life history is very informative. The sisters told us that there have been instances of shoe theft, so, they asked us to keep shoes on even when we walked inside the home. Really they are so kind and considerate to everyone.",Nov-13
Inspiring,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,8-Feb-14,"It is truly inspiring to be where Mother Teresa lived and helped the millions.

A privilege to pay our respects,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,26-Jan-14,"It was one of our strong moments in India, to visit Mother Teresa's house and deliver some much needed medical aid supplies.

wonderful and a must see,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,26-Jan-14,"We walked there from sudder street through the sreets and alleyways. The poverty we witnessed was very real. Once we arrived the Mother Teresa's missionary was closed, but a sister saw us at the door and let us in anyways. Its a beautiful blue building with qoutes of Mother Teresa around leading to her tomb. Very peaceful and quite nice to pray and give thanks to such a peace and love icon. Everyone must see!",Jan-14

The place is beautiful! Simple as should be!",
Simple and perfect,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,15-Jan-14,"Happy I went. 

It is a peaceful yet not what I expected place. Mothers tomb is located in the front room and given an expected amount of reverence. There street and busy sidewalk are immediately outside the window so you can hear traffic and the typical noise of Kolkata, but that all seems perfectly fitting. 

There is an exhibit that documents her life.If you are a big fan of hers or curious to know more it is worth seeing, but there was nothing life changing about that portion of it me. 

The entrance door is on the side of the building and kind of easy to miss the first time. 
I took the metro to the closest stop and then walked there. It was a bit of an adventure, but did not feel unsafe doing so. More",Nov-13
Beautiful memorial to an exceptional woman,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,14-Jan-14,"This little oasis in the middle of the busy streets of Kolkata is such a haven of peace and reflection. Inspiring stories, truth and reality presented in all its grit without rose coloured glasses, beautiful photographs and editorials and the invitation to witness the legacy of one woman being outworked daily by an exceptional group of committed nuns in the very hard life on the kolkata streets. If you are going to Kolkata, Mother House is a must-visit.",Jan-14
Brief Practical Guide to Volunteering at Mother House,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,14-Jan-14,"If you've reached this page, you're probably motivated enough to volunteer at Mother House. That's great, because this place is not full of sad things like poverty & disability as some may portray. Mother house is a place full of love, peace, and almost perfect for self reflection. How do you begin to volunteer at Mother House? One way is that you hang out at the Tea Shop on the pedestrian walk by Sudder Street called Tirupati (it plays reggae music in the evening), and ask any fellow-traveler to take you there the next morning. Likely he or she is a volunteer too. If that doesn't work out, just head to Mother House early morning (be there by 6.30AM), go up to level 2 for the morning mass and follow the crowd to the breakfast area. You'll meet fellow volunteers and Sister Mary Mercy who is the ""commander in chief"" at least for the volunteers. What will I do as a volunteer? There are 5 to 6 'homes' under Missionaries of Charity in Kolkata. Depending on the crowd volume and length of your stay at the breakfast area, you will either be allocated a home (likely Prem Dan) or you can choose (try Nirmal Hridaya @ Kalighat). How do you get to the homes? Just follow your group after breakfast at the breakfast area in Mother House. Trust me, it's as easy as just keeping your eyes & ears open....

Where do you stay to be within walking distance? I stayed at Sudder street in Hotel Paragon @ Stuart Lane (off Sudder Street) for 500 rupees a night in a double bed room (i ended up sharing this with another volunteer) and it took me 20-25 minutes to walk to Mother House - straight through Marquis Street to Alimuddin Street and turn right on AJC Bose Road where Mother House will appear on your right. 

I volunteered there for 7 days. Met some awesome fellow volunteers, mother house sisters and residents of homes of missionaries of charity. More",Dec-13

The Mother House,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,26-Dec-13,"The Mother House became my haven of peace and tranquility in the absolute craziness that is Kolkata. I am Roman Catholic and had come to Kolkata expressly to volunteer with the Missionaries of Charity. Upon arrival, I was completely overwhelmed by the noise, busyness and dirt that confronted me. However, attending daily mass at 6 a.m. gave me fuel to start each day. To be present with those devoted and selfless sisters, to hear them sing, was food for my soul. I spent upward of an hour each day just sitting at Mother's tomb as well. The museum and Mother's room are also very special and are well worth seeing. The sisters are doing wonderful work in attempting to ease the lot of the truly less fortunate. More",Dec-13
Quite special to see Mother's tomb,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,22-Dec-13,"It was actually closed when we arrived but our driver knocked on the door anyway and was let in by a kind nun.

As a single female traveller I found this place to be very calm and peaceful and a real respite from the chaos I had experienced up until visiting the mother house. It is also one of the few places open on a Sunday. I went to the cinema and then to the mother house in the afternoon. That was about all I could do on a Sunday.

Sacred space,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,9-Oct-13,"I went to Mother's House twice when I was in Kolkata. I went on a tour and had the opportunity to see Mother Theresa's simple bedroom, her final resting place and also a small chapel used for prayers. On the second occasion, I got up very early on a Sunday morning and headed to Mother's House for Mass at 0600h. There were a number of volunteers in attendance and also dozens of Sisters of Charities. In the chapel there is also a small statue of Mother Theresa where she always used to sit for Mass etc. Whilst the chapel was very plain, the opportunity to attend Mass in that sacred space was amazing and something that I am very glad I got to do.

A TRIBUTE TO A GREAT MOTHER,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,6-Oct-13,A wonderful place to be in. You feel relieved when you sit and converse with the great mother. Sad to note that there are a lot of unwanted elements who lurk around such a saintly place to steal the belongings of the devotees. The room that the Mother lived in is so simple and so austere. The belongings are so sacred. Another is the tragedy that one of Mother's belonging was stolen and I only hope that the kind sisters get it back.,Aug-13

The cleanest historical site in Kolkata,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,27-Aug-13,"I liked the clean, modest exterior of Mother's House. Inside, it was similar - calm, white and quiet. Very peaceful. 

The museum, where you can't take photos, gives you a very full history of Mother's life. I loved her pen and pencil case in which sat a sharpener, eraser, 6 inch scale and one pen and pencil. And, I discovered that she started her career as a Loreto nun. I too attended a Loreto school and college. And to my surprise, one of her batch mates in Entally was a nun who taught me in Asansol, West Bengal.

One has to take in the sight of her modest dwelling with God-given lenses only, as photography is not allowed there. Just outside of the House you will spot the hand-pulled (hatu tanna) rickshaws, which, if I am not mistaken, you will not see annnywhere else in the world.. This happens only in Kolkata! More",Feb-13

A must....,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Apr-13,"Set in the craziness of kolkata, you get a idea of what a beautiful woman she was. Her room shows how humble she was. There are nuns there that worked with Mother Theresia, which is amazing. It is a very small place but worth the visit.

Insightful and Moving,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,1-Apr-13,"We walked to The Mother House from New Market area and it was totally worth the walk. The walk isn't actually too far and would save you the taxi fare. 

The entire experience was really insightful and informative. Before arriving I knew very little of the life and work of Mother Teresa and I left feeling rather inspired and well informed. The place was perfectly silent and after viewing the museum we walked upstairs to take a look at Mother's room and we heard some of the most beautiful singing. 

Well worth the detour from central Kolkata.",Apr-13
Goosebumps,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,1-Apr-13,"What a wonderful experience to visit THE convent of Mother Theresa.

food for the mind and soul,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Mar-13,"Much has already been said...seeing Mother Teresa's room was a humbling and inspiring experience..there is nothing new that that place tells us imo, but for me it provides a glimpse of certain values and principles manifested in brick and mortar, as a result of how someone chose to live her life..there is something soulful about this place and it is difficult to describe but can be exprienced almost tangibly",Mar-13
Worth the Time,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,20-Mar-13,"I have visited Mother House several times over the past few years when I have traveled to Kolkata to volunteer at Mother Teresa's homes. I would encourage any visitor to the City of Joy to make the time to visit Mother House, regardless of your religious background. Guests can see the austere and simple room where Mother Teresa lived, visit her tomb, and learn about her life at the little ""museum"" located in the room next to her tomb. 

If you want to enrich your experience, then join the Missionaries of Charity and volunteers from all over the world at the 6:00 AM mass. I especially love to hear the Sisters singing early in the morning at mass. It is a beautiful experience. 

Guests to Mother House can also walk one block farther down AJC Bose Street to visit Shishu Bhavan, Mother Teresa's home for abandoned children. Shishu Bhavan is also the place where the Missionaries hold orientation three times a week for volunteers who want to serve in Mother Teresa's homes. Volunteers begin their day every morning at Mother House before heading off to their respective assignments. 

Whether you visit for one day or serve as a volunteer at Mother Teresa's homes, Mother House is a must-see place in Kolkata and worth the time. More",Mar-13

Extremely moving and beautiful,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,15-Mar-13,"This was the highlight of my visit to Kolkata. As a Catholic, it was a very spiritual, moving experience. Praying at her tomb is incredible. The nuns are extremely gracious and seem so happy! 

There is an excellent display of relics relating to her life-including clothing items, books, rosaries, etc. I went in the off-season, and it was still a little crowded-it's very small. 

Also, if you would like to make a donation, it's not very evident. I had to ask one of the nuns where it was.. . .they will give you a card and a blessed medal, and also bless you and pray for you. 

You can also see where Mother Teresa lived, it's a tiny room on the second floor. No photos though.

THE MOST SWEETEST PLACE IN THE WHOLE WORLD,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,11-Mar-13,I recently visited this beautiful spiritual serene place and felt so good and peaceful inside me words will never be able to describe the sanctity and pureness in this holy place. From the very first step u make inside this place a feeling of peace captivates you and watching the nuns go about their regular routine of washing clothes...cleaning...helping others is inspiring to say the least...the early morning 6 am mass along with the nuns is divine . The simple breakfast of bread plantain and tea fills u with so much love. The little tiny room the great mother stayed in is a sight to behold .The nuns are always there to lend a helping hand and advice and meeting sister PREMA was just beautiful.....seeing most of the nuns getting blessed by her after mass is definitely a sight to behold...it is definitely heaven on earth and i just cant wait to be back there and feel the goodness all around.

Not catholic at all,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,4-Mar-13,"If you are catholic and you kinda expect to find a somewhat catholic spiritual place here - try to get rid of that thought as fast as possible. 
It reminded me of a cult, not so much a pilgrimage location. 

However it is very interesting to see her grave and her noble prize. You will have to search for it though as it is hidden under some barbie puppets. Sounds awkward? Well it is. 

Besides that the sisters are very nice and friendly and nobody harrasses you or forces you to leave some money or anything.",Mar-13
"Inspiring place, calm and touching",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,1-Mar-13,"This is a must go sight; the type that you leave reflecting about the story of someone who has devoted her life to help others.

Serene & Divine,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Feb-13,"Visiting Mother House in Kolkata was like a dream come true. While on business one hardly gets to do sightseeing but this time around on my way to a meeting my driver told me about Mother House and it was just a coincidence that I ended up going to the place. Even though the visiting hours were over, the sister there allowed me to go a pray at the Mother's Tomb. It was a magical experience. Even though they allow people to enter with shoes, for some strange reason I just couldn't allow myself to enter with my shoes on. I went inside and saw this magnificent marble tomb underneath lay the Mother who has inspired millions like me. Praying at her tomb and kissing the foot of the tomb was a divine experience - as if Mother's call had come and hence I was pulled towards it. I sat there on the floor for quite sometime before realizing that I was getting late for my meetings. I took a quite stroll around the tomb, kissed it good bye with a request to Mother to remember me in her prayers. It's a spot you got to visit at least once in your lifetime. Thank you Mother for the calling! More",Feb-13
True charity,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Feb-13,"Here's to a dedicated group of Sisters who help these local people on a daily basis with no strings attached, other than showing up for the visit.

More than expected BUT watch out for the scam outside,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,25-Jan-13,"Wel i wasnt planning on going here during my 4 days in Calcutta but i'm very glad i did. Fantastic atmosphere and a great little museum. How often do you get to see a Nobel Peace Prize just sitting there in front of you? 
When we left we were approached by a lady on the street asking for money for milk for her baby. Ok fine , i reach into my pocket but she says ""No you buy"" and points to the Mother Teresa gift shop just up the road. Thats strange , its the first time money has been knocked back ever on my 3 trips to India. So go the the gift shop. And the guy says as we walk in ""what do you want ....baby formula?"" 2000rp! Really? So your a gift shop but you just happen to have an empty can of baby formula under the counter worth 2000rp ?? Right im out of here! No one argues as they have been sprung.

Very special!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,25-Jan-13,"My last day in Kolkata and I walked from my hotel to the Mother House with clear directions and a determination not to go by taxi or receive any help finding it. After a week in the City, I was well used to some of the extraordinary and challenging sights as well as the constant, but not particularly threatening, begging. I knew I must be getting close when people kept yelling to me ""MotherHouse?"" And offering to 'guide' me. So, amid the mayhem of the street, I was relieved to come across it , well signposted just off AJBose Road. It's a wonderful, cheerful and quiet place with the young sisters quietly going about their business. Though there were a lot of people there when I arrived at around 3.30, it was getting towards Mass time and they were either leaving or going to Mass. I read the excellent exhibition material, sat in front of Mothers tomb as young and old came and went and then, mounted the staircase to see, alone, her small room where she lived and died. So moving. So simple. I had brought some clothes from home, which I gave the sisters on duty, and also made a cash donation of some GBP I had in my possession, which was gratefully accepted, and acknowledged by a receipt and a chat with a lovely young sister.

Inspirational,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Jan-13,"We have visited the Mother House on two different trips to Kolkata and what an inspirational place it is. As practicing Catholics we were especially moved by the humility and devotion shown by the Missionaries of Charity, and the joyful demeanor of the nuns and priests we spoke with. Mother Teresa was a saintly woman and her work is carried on by the selfless women and men we met. 

At the Mother House you can see her tomb, room, and a display that recounts her life. We were lucky to catch the last half of a Mass said by a visiting American priest and resident Costa Rican priest. Father Belisario, the Costa Rican, even went an hour out of his way to help us meet one of the Missionaries who was our friend's cousin. 

Calcutta has its share of poverty, but it seems like it has a richer soul than more developed cities that are full of shopping malls, luxury hotels, and fancy cars. The Mother House is one of the reasons why I love Calcutta. More",Jan-13
tranquility,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Jan-13,the visit to this shrine was amazing experience......the tranquility and simplicity at the shrine an ode to Mother Teresa has to be experienced.,Dec-12
Gods work,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,23-Jan-13,"The sisters here are still carrying out Mother Teresa's work in this lovely working convent.

Must visit for Catholics,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,20-Jan-13,"I think it will be every Catholic's joy to see Mother Teresa's resting place, the house itself that became the center of her ministry.... the things that she used... her room and the bed that she used. 

Lovely to see also other sisters who have committed to continue her ministry.",Jan-13

I could feel the holy presence here!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,17-Jan-13,"Not very easy to get there but trust me, your calcutta visit is incomplete without visiting the Mother's Tomb. 
I could not believe the humility that Mother Teresa stayed with and is deeply inculcated in everything at mother's house.",Dec-12
never to miss,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,17-Jan-13,I was told by my friends back home to pay a visit to mother house on my trip to the city. I was fortunate to come to know about someone who had made such a great impact on many around the world.,Nov-12
inspiring,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,13-Jan-13,"Great to learn more about this impressive woman and her life achievements. Be careful as our guide insisted on taking us after to the orphanage run by the sisters down the road - we were turned away as the kids were asleep, which in retrospect was good as they are not a tourist attraction!",Jan-13
A grounding experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,12-Jan-13,In our short visit to donate childrens clothes and shoes we experienced a sense of peace and purpose that Mother Teresa and her Sisters of Charity have brought to their work in this city. Watch out for the scam artists outside who ask you to buy milk for their children from a store nearby. It is better to channel your donations through the Mother House.,Dec-12
A blessing,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,12-Jan-13,"It was a blessing to see where this great lady lived and worked. Her mission carries on and the dedicated sisters are angels of mercy. 

Mother's tomb in on the grounds and open to the public. It is just a simple marble tomb and prayer cards are available and free medals are given to those who ask. A small museum is located adjacent and Mother Tesesa's sandals, world map, and personal belongs are there. You can also climb upstairs to view her room. 

This was our sole reason to visit Calcutta (Kolkata) and we happy that we did so.",Nov-12
Very moving and inspiring,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,10-Jan-13,"When we finally found the Mother House we were glad we had made the effort, although there was building work going on at the time of our visit we found the display of Mother Theresa's life and amazing work most interesting. We have grown up with many a story on the TV of Mother Theresa's work but couldn't believe the extent of what she had achieved. To be able to see first hand the simple surroundings that she spent so much time in was very moving. A warning about the professional beggars is given inside, do not give money,sweets even toothpaste to encourage what they are doing....their children are turning down the opportunity to go to school to beg with their families....or more like the parents are not allowing their children the opportunity of education. Well worth visiting. More",Jan-13

Life changing,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,6-Jan-13,"Mother Teresa's life is very inspiring. There were masses at 6:30 in the morning. We only had a couple of days to volunteer, but if you're interested in volunteering, just ask around. It's usually organized after the early mass in the volunteer's area (down the stairs, to the left of the museum).",Dec-12
awesome,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,6-Jan-13,"no wonder , mother Teresa got the Nobel and Sainthood !everything is well organised and my heart went out to the children who were being taken care of so nicely .",Dec-12
A moving experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,4-Jan-13,Incredible experience; this is a very humble building; it had many visitors there when we were there but it still felt peaceful. You can sit in quiet thought and / or visit a small 'museum' on site which depicts Mother Teresas life. There is something quite spiritual about this place. The sisters are happy to talk / listen and you can take pictures. You can also attend Mass should you want to. It is free to get in so PLEASE leave a donation.,Feb-12
If we want to know Mother better must visit,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,4-Jan-13,"Its excellent, Mother House..

Wonderful way to your bit,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,22-Dec-12,"This is one place which is genuinely trying to make the world the a better place.

In one of the most crowded square miles on earth,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,11-Dec-12,"I used to live walking distance from this site. And in two weeks I'll be visiting again, to say hi to a couple of the sisters I've always been fond of. 

It's the place where a tiny child died in my arms. 

More important, it's just in perhaps the most crowded square mile on earty, ironic in that Mother was so dogmatically opposed to birth control. 

And take a train from the nearby Sealdah railway station, even more crowded than the one in Howrah. It will be an experience you will NEVER forget, I assure you.",Dec-12
Life of a determined woman,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,3-Dec-12,Heard lots of stories about the life of Mother Teresa. It was good feeling to visit and know about her more. Saw collections from past. She was a humble woman.,Nov-12
"not much to see, much to take in",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,2-Dec-12,"You feel very humble & very blessed we all are able to do what we want, when you want to do it. 
You see all her belonging such as what they are eg shoes & sweater her bed room, all very spartan as you might expect. 
After reading all her famous words you can go & see her tomb. 
Note the place shuts at 1 pm for lunch. 
You are not permitted to take pictures except of the tomb. 
Takes about 1 hour but you could spend longer. 
Free entry & the nuns give children chocolate.",Dec-12
know about Mother Teresa,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,29-Nov-12,I was impressed with the way the whole house exhibits the life of Mother Teresa. Knowing about her makes you realize the important things she did in her life.,Oct-12

Very moving,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,28-Nov-12,"This is the kind of place that you think about after you've left. No pictures are allowed inside except of Mother's Tomb. We spent quite a while visiting the exhibits and reading about Mother's life, and seeing the simple possessions Mother owned and room where Mother spent her last days. Truly a remarkable woman who dedicated her whole life to helping others. It is nice to see the Sisters in the blue and white saris still carrying on her work. Very peaceful place.",Nov-12
"Faith, or no faith.......one should definitely go. Well worth a visit!",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,28-Nov-12,"A most humbling experience. One should not visit Kolkata without visiting Mother House. Even though I am an atheist I was deeply moved by not only the life story and history of such an icon, but the serenity and peacefulness of Mother House in the chaos and noise that surrounds you, only inches away. All you can hear are the soft voices of the nuns singing hymns.If I stayed longer perhaps even I could convert! It's very simple and basic, as convents and monasteries are, but the exhibition room, Mother Theresa's room and her tomb are in keeping with her life. Very few people on this planet have devoted their lives to such goodness. 
A good tip.... Mother Theresa's room is closed between 2 to 3.00pm but you can still visit the exhibition room and tomb, so they are completely quiet at this time, the best time to visit. Also, because talking is not allowed and there are no signs asking for donations, please feel free to drop anything at all into the slit above the drawer near Mother Theresa's tomb. It all helps and is going to the best cause! 
Also, again because of lack of signs, make sure to pay a visit to the orphanage. I missed it, but maybe that was no bad thing. If I had entered I'm sure I would have come out an emotional wreck! More",Nov-12
A Mothers Heart,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,26-Nov-12,"Mother Teresa was one of a kind. It gave me goose bumps.to see and to read her life story. To understand why someone spent their whole life helping others and is still helping even though they are not here on this earth anymore. Please spend some time here and then go to the orphanage and ,met some of the beautiful children and the volunteers. This place will certainly open your heart.",Nov-12
Humbling experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,25-Nov-12,"Very humbling experience. It is well worth a visit. Informative ""museum,"" detailiing Mother's life and work in Calcutta. You also get viewing access to her private room and see her final resting place. If you want to make a donation you have to speak to one one of the nuns in attendence. Please do because they do not ask,",Nov-12
Mother's House,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,23-Nov-12,"The Mother's House has now become a sanctuary for many to visit. It is a place where you can see where one woman who has the vision and compassion to do 'GOOD"" for many regardless of their religion, had in fact, succeeded in changing the outcome of many lives. It is definitely worthwhile to also visit the orphanage, you see children, from babies to 5-6 years old who have a chance to have good health, and possibly a good life. This is such a stark contrast to the babies and children on the streets (side walks) of Calcutta. You see babies sleeping on rags on the cement of the side walks - they still look like angels, fast asleep. So when you can see small children of all ages living in Mother's House, a safe place, you know that Mother Teresa felt such deep compassion and care that she did something. I often hear people say ""what can we do? To quote Mother Teresa ""There is Always Something We can Do"". I would like to reach out to people to do 'SOMETHING"". Mother's House definitely is a worthwhile place to visit, one that actually will take you out of your own comfort zone and make you search for your heart. More",Nov-12
Peaceful and Pleasant,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,23-Nov-12,"The grounds of the Mother House are very well kept, as the home is still running and their are many nuns in residence there. You can visit the tomb where their are candles lit, and flowers placed, and is the only place where you can take a picture. They also have a small box in which you can write prayer requests. 

In the second room you can see documentation of Mother Teresa's life. It is quite a lot to read, as she lived quite a life, but it is very informative. They request that you refrain from talking, so even if there are quite a few people there- it is peaceful and serene. 

Additionally, you can sit on a benches in the courtyard and see her room. Definitely worth a visit. More",Oct-12
good to see,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Nov-12,"their self service and dedications was superb. Although spent very less time, I wish I would have stayed more days in Kolkata to explore more about this great lady GOD.",Nov-12
worth a visit,jools011,"Pulborough, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,19-Nov-12,I am surprised you can actually take photos of the tomb itself. The convent itself is very humble (no photos) as is Mother Teresa's home. The room with all the history of her is most interesting. It makes you realise just what she did and what a lovely lady she was.,Nov-12
lovely to see,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,19-Nov-12,"I am surprised you can take photos of the tomb. The convent itself is very humble as is Mother Teresa's room.

A place worth visiting many times,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,10-Nov-12,"It is so simple, yet so real and holy. You can feel the presence of Mother Teresa. Best if you can experience this place in her way- to love those people that she once devoted her life to.

Very informative,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,8-Nov-12,"It was so inspiring to see & learn about Mother Teresa at the Mother House. It was so peaceful. Everything about the site was so simple (not in a negative sense but simple in the sense the design of the site, nuns outfits and facilities, her room, etc.). There is a small library where it displays Mother Teresa's belongings and tells the tales of her life. The stories were so touching - and her dedication to helping the poor and marginalized people of Calcutta was so inspirational. It was an honour to visit the site and I think everyone should visit if given the chance!",Oct-12
Nice place to visit,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,8-Nov-12,"Whilst the museum is a little jumbled (the exhibits are numbered, but not necessarily hung in the right order, or at all), it’s a nice place to go and visit.",Nov-12
Very inspiring,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,6-Nov-12,"I think the house reflects the sacrifices of a lady, and also inspires us to live for others. Mother Teresa is a legend, and the house keeps her legacy alive.",Mar-12
A Truly Humbling Experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,25-Oct-12,"Using Sudder Street as the ""tourist"" reference point, it was about a 30min walk East along Park Street. You go past a few old Anglo cemeteries, where some of the large tombs date back to the late 1700s. I found I started noticing the poverty the closer I got to Mother House - not because there was more of it, but that I make more aware. Everyone knows it as Mother House and can help point you in the right direction. 

The facilities are simple, as she was a simple women. There is a small museum of her life there, and the Sisters are very kind. Mother Theresa is also buried there and you can visit the sight and pay your respects. 

A must if you come to Kolkata - truly humbling as you come so close to a true Saint of the modern era More",
Peaceful escape from the bustling dirty streets.,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,5-Oct-12,"If you can only see one thing in kolkata, then is should be it. 

It's relatively easy to find, the entrance is just slightly down an alleyway. There will be a beggar at the end of the alley who will walk you there. You don't need them to walk you there as its very easy to see. Just say no. If they do walk you there, when you leave they will harass you for money. 

On entering its a beautiful courtyard, and you quickly forget where you are. The house/facility is still in use today and you will see many sisters going about ere daily work. He sisters are very friendly and will pass the time of day with you. There are three sections once inside; mother Teresa's tomb, a museum and mother Teresa's room. 

The tomb is very touching. You can take flowers home with you from the tomb. The museum is very, very, very informative. There is too much writing to read so don't feel bad about skim reading. The things on display range from the interesting to the weird; mother Teresa's cardigan, her pen, her used tissue...her needles from hospital. 

He bedroom is also interesting to see. 

You can visit any day 9-12 and 3-6. I think if you go on a Monday or Wednesday at 3 that you can go and volunteer with the sisters for an afternoon. More",Sep-12
Impressive,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,3-Oct-12,"before my visit, I wasn't aware of Mother Teresa's history in Kolkata.

Gets you thinking,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-Sep-12,We visited the Mother Teresa house and the Sishu Bhavan orphinage home where my girlfriend was born.

It was a simple museum, but I just could not stop reading about her devotion to and love for God.

In addition to the museum, you could also view her tomb and the tiny, hot room she took her last breath in. Overall, an extremely humbling experience.",Mar-12

A nice quiet area of Kolkata,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,2-Aug-12,"Mother House was a bit difficult to find, and a man sitting on the side of the road seemed to be very helpful in leading us the way and not asking for any money in return. We were suspicious at first, but after he left us at the entrance we thought he was nothing but a kind old man (how very wrong we were -- but more on this later) Inside it was quiet and peaceful, and we were led to Mother Teresa's tomb. We sat there for a while, just thinking about where we actually were, and taking it all in. You are allowed to take photos in this area. We unfortunately didn't get to go for a tour of the rest of the house, as it was closed on this day. On leaving, the old man tracked us down and when we offered him some money, he refused. Instead, he herded us into a nearby shop (which SEEMED to sell nothing but Mother Teresa souvenirs) and asked us to please buy some baby milk - which happened to be under the counter, and cost $50 AUD - much more than we were offering him in terms of cash. He kept refusing cash donations until we told him multiple times that we couldn't afford the expensive baby milk - then he gave up and accepted the cash.

You'd be better off arranging to volunteer for a day if you have the time. The tomb itself is interesting and many of the artifacts they've chosen to preserve are indicative of Mother Theresa's life.",Jun-12
Incorrect address but finally found it!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,27-Jun-12,"Nobody has heard of lower circular road. Not even the traffic police so it's best to ask for Ripon st. It's on that street. 
A lovely visit and worth the trouble locating it.",
The final resting place,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-Jun-12,"This is the final resting place of our beloved and revered Blessed Mother Teresa, who dedicated her life serving the poor, sick, orphaned, homeless, destitute, helpless old-aged people and the dying, while guiding the Missionaries of Charity's expansion, first throughout India and then in other countries. Take a bow, sit down in the peaceful environment of the House and make a prayer, if you like. We were absolutely amazed by the simplicity of life led by the late Mother. 
Note: In case you are confused finding directions, don’t hesitate asking the local people. Kolkatans are more than eager to help you in case of need.",Jan-12
Great,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,7-Jun-12,Interesting - but getting there was hard - no one seemed to know where it was - drove for ages,Mar-12
Wondserful palce to spend an hour or two,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,7-Jun-12,"Very tranquil and nostalgic, thinking about all of the wonderful work that has been done from this small indescript house. It's a bit hard to find, as the sign is very small and you have to walk down a small laneway, but ask any local and they will point you in the right direction. Take the time to see Mother House, it's well worth it.",Mar-12
Mother House - A pilgrimage not to be missed,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,6-Jun-12,"If not for the signage, you would think that the door to Mother House belongs to the house of a middle class Bengali family. Lady, whom Kings & Monarchs bowed to, whom politicians sought, whom celebrities envied, could have turned her abode in to a palace. But the simplicity of abode and humility of sisters reflect the value system of Mother and her mission - Sacrifice, Service, Love and Simplicity. This is a pilgrimage that every visitor to Kolkata must make.",May-12
Do Visit,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,1-Jun-12,This was amazing--the simplicity of how Mother Theresa lived and the largeness of what she accomplished was brought out in the still working Mother House. A french mass was being said while I visited making it even more special.,Jan-12

Divine Experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,29-Apr-12,A must visit place.You will feel her presence and blessings in every nooks and corners of her house.She may not be physically present over there but each corner is special by her touch.No more words to express inner feelings.Come to Calcutta and feel her.,Apr-12
Blessings from Mother Teresa...,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,28-Apr-12,"What a closeness to Mother Teresa and her group of sisters who carry on her work for lepers and orphans in Kolkatta.Selfless work.Amazing peaceful and insightful. 

Besides all the architectural beautyof the museum, st Pauls cathedral and the Victoria Memeorial which show you the English architecture left behind in Kolkatta go and visit the saint of the poor.It is a very humbling experience..worth giving back to poor ....",Apr-12

Highlight,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,2-Apr-12,Small attraction but big on biographical info regarding Mother Theresa in the room next to tomb. The sisters exude sweetness.,Apr-12
"Interesting and tranquil place, bit of a trek to reach it",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,1-Apr-12,"This is a working convent, which it is normally possible to visit, but it was closed on the day we went, so check before you go if you want to see how the nuns live. Mother Theresa's tomb is open every day, and is a good place for a few seconds of contemplation.",Mar-12
The Trip of a Lifetime,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,28-Mar-12,"The Mother House, the people from all over the world that we met there and the sisters are an experience I will treasure forever. Walking the streets of Kolkata where Mother Theresa worked and walked left an indelible imprint on my heart. The Mother House is a working convent where visitors are received daily. One can attend mass, visit Mother's tomb, and even volunteer in some of the centers she established. The nuns feed volunteers breakfast before sending them off for a morning of volunteering with the ""poorest of the poor"" in the streets of India. Kolkata is a safe place for foreigners. We were three American women who were treated with grace and respect everywhere we went. We were out on foot day and night in the city along with so many other people and were perfectly safe. We rode in taxis, rickshaws, auto-rickshaws, buses, and trains without a problems. It is loud, hot, and very dirty. Your senses are accosted each morning when you walk outside. All the senses are fully engaged from the time you open your eyes in the morning. The Indian people were by and large friendly and gracious.

Serenity and dedication,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,4-Mar-12,"I'm thrilled I had the pleasure visiting Mother Teresa's House, I was not prepared for this unexpected visit. Seeing the dedication of the sisters of Mother Teresa's order, the good work she started and they continue, is truly a humbling experience. Highly recommended. On Thursdays Mother Teresa's room can't be visited.",Feb-12
Peaceful in its simplicity,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,29-Feb-12,"A must visit if you are Kolkatta but suprisingly, 2 out of 3 cab drivers that I have encountered there don't know Mother's House, I am guessing they probably know her by her Hindi reference so you need to find that out. After seeing Mother's House, you can proceed to Victoria Memorial which is nearby (but you need to take cab)",Feb-12
A wonderful place to volunteer,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,28-Feb-12,Such a beautiful place to visit or if you have time on your hands to actually volunteer. I have volunteered here a few times and just love every minute of it.,Mar-11
Humble and peaceful,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,25-Feb-12,"A place you should not miss. Take your time, visit the exhibition about Mother Theresa (quite crowded in a small room), see her room and kneel before her tomb.",Jan-12
Mother Teresa's abode,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,16-Feb-12,"Mother House is for many a place of pilgrimage, particularly because of Mother Teresa - a present day Saint.",Oct-11

A Pilgrimage,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,16-Feb-12,"Enter, and you can feel that Kolkata's Mother still lives here.",
a must visit,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,8-Feb-12,Do visit this place---- I find peace everytime i visit it.,
What a joy to behold!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,1-Feb-12,We went to the Mother House not sure what to expect...and what a treat it was. These are the most gracious women working tirelessly for the poor and sick of Calcutta...but the remarkable thing is that they do it with such joy. They do not mind visitors. YOu can see Mother Teresa's tomb and take a holy card and some flower petals from off her tomb. Spend some time and prayer and thank the dear Lord for sending caring women like this to minister to the most forsaken of the world!,Jan-12
Mother Teresa,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,28-Jan-12,We all love Mother and its definitely a peace place to visit.She has done a many things for us.The environment is very good.,Feb-11
A must when in Kolkata,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Jan-12,"Moving. In no way ostentatious. The history on display about Mother Theresa's life was informative. No pressure to give money, although there is an opportunity to support a very worthy charitable cause. As Jesus says in the Bible: ""in as much as you have done unto the least..you have done it unto Me"".",Feb-11
A great little lady!!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,21-Jan-12,"Within the confines of the building there is actually not much to see and do!! in one room is mother Teresa's tomb which is nice to spend some time in peace! in the next room is a display which chronicles the whole of her amazing life!! I suppose at the end of the day it does'nt matter what religion you are or what religion she was, whats important is that she dedicated her life to helping others along with the other nuns that are doing exactly the same thing there now, which I think is amazing!!",Jun-11
MOTHER TERESA,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,18-Jan-12,"MAA is always a loving word for any child, so is mother's house. Whatever one could not say to anyone, could be told with MAA.",
Truly moving,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,15-Jan-12,"We visited the Mother House on January 1 very early in the morning. We had heard about Mother Theresa before but were far from realising the extent of her accomplishments. The exhibition inside the Mother House was very interesting, but the room is maybe a bit small for so much information. One of the sisters opened the gate to Mother Theresa's former room, which struck us by its simplicity.",Dec-11
be inspired!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,10-Jan-12,"Really nice little museum with panels that chart her life story. really interesting and simply done with nice handwritten letters and historical context. This trip would take about 1-1.5 hours. 

They won't let me submit this review unless it's 200 characters but I have nothing else to say, so...",Jan-12
Mother House,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,9-Jan-12,"Mother house on A.J.C Bose Road the final resting place. 
People including celebrities come here to pay their respects to Mother Teresa's simple tomb here. 
Mother's worn sandals and battered enamel dinner-bowl can also be seen here. 
This building has no glamorous carving or architecture but in fact it is actually a reflection of her simplicity and attitude to life. Signifying Simple living and high thinking.",
Don't miss - very special experience!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,9-Jan-12,This place has an amazing aura and it is so special to get close to the place where Mother Teresa lived and died and to learn more about her life. Inspiring.,Dec-11
A really spiritual place,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,8-Jan-12,The place is where mother Theresa lived. It is a great place to visit. It is a very tranquil place. You can buy a candle from the shops on the street and light it here in honour of Mother Theresa. Its a nice place to learn more about this great icon.,Dec-11
Inspirational - worth a visit,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,8-Jan-12,Mother house now houses a tomb for Mother Teressa and a museum showcasing her work and time. Beautiful place to spend some time. A diffrent experience altogether. Reminds us that there were such people in the world who put their lives in serving humanity - people who still make us keep faith in the goodness of human beings.,Nov-11
pas grand chose à voir,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,8-Jan-12,prévouez une visite de 5 à 10 minutes max. pour visiter. Bous pouvez voir le tombeau et la chambre de Mère Teresa. Cest gratuit.,Dec-11
Inspiring,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,22-Dec-11,The Mother House contains the tomb of Mother Teresa and also a museum chronicling her life. I found this extremely interesting. I also visited her room and could envisage something of her life of service. The sisters were welcoming and those that spoke English were informative and very lovely women.,Oct-11
A must visit when in Kolkata !,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,16-Dec-11,See the humble sisters do their routine ! Great service to humanity. Makes you feel so small and real ! Want to comeback and be a volunteer sometime.,Dec-11
Mother House well worth a visit.,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,12-Dec-11,I was impressed to read Mother Theresa's life story.It was impressive to hear all the good work which she and her followers have done for the poor and destitute.As we were leaving we met an Irish volunteer and he showed great enthusiasm for his work in Mother House.,Nov-11
Shrine to Charity,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,3-Dec-11,"This house and headquarters for mother Theresa's charity work in Kolkata is turned into a shrine for worshippers. Photographs and explanations of her life are on display. You can go up the stairs and see the tiny, very basic room in which she lived and died. Other rooms still seem to be used as offices to continue her work.",Dec-11
Mother Theresa of Kolkata,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,1-Dec-11,"It was a bit difficult locating the place as the local driver didn't know where it was. But after entering the place, the experience was truly touching. So humbled before a Saint like Mother Theresa. One should definitely visit this place...the memories will remain for long.",Nov-11
Peace of mind,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,28-Nov-11,I visited Mother house and found a place where you one can enjoy peace of mind . Just spending time there brings peace and joy in your heart. The photo gallery can be done more better by using latest communication technology . There can be more space to provide more interactive information on work of Mother and her organisation.,Nov-11
Ok but be aware they close mid day,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,11-Nov-11,went to Mother House. Ok - saw her tomb as well as accomplishments but we arrived mid day and had to come back later on as they were closed.,Oct-11
Moving and a must to visit.,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Oct-11,"Iconic in the history of Calcutta, this is a must to visit. Easier by taxi - agree a price first for a single or return trip and agree a 30-45 minute waiting time but don't pay for the latter as the driver will be grateful for the return fare anyway - have the right money to pay the driver. The Mother House includes Mother Teresa's tomb and is moving in its simplicity. Nuns and novices frequently pop in to pray. If you want to give something direct to a charity in India (don't give to the street beggars who are often the victims of organised crime) find a nun and offer some of your holiday cash. It will be put to good use (no middle men). More",Oct-11
Mother is 'in',,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,8-Oct-11,"At the entrance is a wooden sign to say that 'Mother is in'. 
The surrounding area brings the stories about Mother Teresa and her convent to life. It is a 'working house', you can visit and you are made welcome but (thankfully) it is not a place to go for a photo opportunity, you will not come back with pictures of beaming sisters and anybody whose camera was at the ready was firmly put in their place. This is a working convent, there is a museum dedicated to Mother Teresa, you can see the room where she lived and you can visit her grave - and everybody is busy getting on with their daily life. You can take a memento though: Mother Teresa's grave is surrounded by fresh flowers and you can take a bloom to remind you of your visit. It is a humbling environment and a beacon of hope in an area that is very poor. More",Jan-11
astonishing emotional power,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,31-Aug-11,"This is not an attraction! This is a place of astonishing emotional power. It is neither beautiful nor atmospheric, but immensely moving. The simplicity and pure goodness of what goes on is abundantly clear, and we were, completely to our surprise, overwhelmed. If you want to know more about Mother Teresa this is the place to go; you will learn a lot from the little museum, but more from seeing her room and simply experiencing the place.",Aug-11
Most emotioanl experience in a lifetime,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,22-Feb-09,"An introductory remark: Trip Advisor needs to make a correction to the Mother Teresa locales in the Attractions section of Calcutta. What is there is misleading. I’ll try to clear it up: There are two locations to visit regarding Mother Teresa. One is the convent where she lived and that is the site of her tomb – that is the “Mother House”. The other is the “Mother House for the sick and dying” at an entirely different location. I recommend going to the House for the sick and dying first. If you have an interest in gaining an understanding about this incredible woman, you must visit both. The Mother House has her tomb as well as a simple but very effective museum that explains what she did and why she did it tracing her life from childhood to death. But the Mother House for the sick and dying is an active hospice with dozens of beds filled with the dying that is a living testimonial to what she really did.

They are about 15 minutes apart by taxi. 
First I will cover the Mother House for the sick and dying. I happened to arrive there on a Sunday morning about 11 a.m. and walked in during the middle of a prayer service. The building is small and Spartan but was packed with people joined in prayer. Just beyond the small prayer area, there is a dormitory-style rows of beds filled with human beings who are clearly on their last legs. A few had IV’s but for the most part they were just living out their days. Tourists were roaming among them providing what comfort they could. I am 60 years old and well travelled and have seen a lot in my lifetime. The emotional impact of that room was overwhelming and stunning. It caused an emotional stir in the soul that was unparallel in my entire lifetime. I doubt it would matter what your religious beliefs are….this house leaves one speechless. 
The Mother House on Bose Road, by contrast, is more satisfying if you’ve already been to the House for the Sick and Dying. When you arrive there you are curious about what person could have thought to be dedicated to loving the poorest of the poor in the world. Why and how did she do it? Those questions are answered in the museum. The exhibits are very simple – essentially a series of poster boards chronicling her life. Interspersed among the boards are display cases containing her food utensils, cross that she wore, her sandals, bible and so on. It does give you the feeling that she had a singular mind and purpose to her life and it is most inspiring. 
Finally, the Mother House has her tomb. Like everything else about her it is quite simple – slabs of white marble with an eternal flame at the head. There was no line to get in and it does inspire one to kneel and say a prayer in her name. 
A final observation: interestingly enough, I saw no “donation boxes” and never once heard a hint of solicitation. In fact, quite the opposite. When I signed the visitors register at the Mother House (convent), I was given a tiny “Miraculous medal” along with a small flyer explaining its importance in the life of Mother Teresa with no indication that anything was expected in return. Later, when leaving, I pressed some dollars into the hand of the nun near the door. She asked me write my name so that she and her sisters could say prayers for me as thanks for the donation. I didn’t expect her to do anything but she did. 
It would be poetic to say that my life was somehow changed by the experience but I don’t think it was. What this visit did afford was a chance to experience a spirituality that was incredible and different from any experience in a lifetime. You can genuinely feel the presence of a saintly person in these houses. More",

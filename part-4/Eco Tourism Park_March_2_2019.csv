Awesome place to spend your day,Bobby0512,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,28-Feb-19,"Ecopark is located in Rajarhat very close to City Centre 2. Entry is reasonably priced at Rs 30 each. Parking is Rs 20 for bikes and 100 for cars. It is best to enter from gate no 2 if you want to take the electric car or the toy train as the only booking counter is located there. 

The park is huge with an awesome water body adding to the beauty. Replicas of Eiffel tower, Taj Mahal and Leaning Tower of Pisa give the shutterbugs lots of time to spend. The rose garden is beautiful. Bumping cars in the pond is another new thing to see. 

Food options are very limited and disappointing although you are allowed to carry your own food inside. 

The park is closed on Mondays. More",Jan-19

Nothing as it seems,wanderer2174,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,8-Mar-19,We had a hard time trying to find out about heritage tours which the trams used to make before.. The staff at WB transport office were very kind and nice. They informed us about the daily tram tours and some of the tram routes were now not in use. We were shocked to see the state of the trams now running in the city..absolutely ramshackled....we took a decision not to go on the tram. I hope the government really spruces up the trams which used to be a delight to watch in older days.,Feb-19

Most of the routes have closed down, few are still in operation, managed by old, rundown, rickety 2 coach trams. Still the cheapest mode of public transport, moves slowly, allowing tourists to enjoy the city ride. We took the Esplanade-Kidderpore-Esplanade ride, the 1st route that started after Electric trams were introduced in the city in 1902. It goes via the touristy Maidan area, around the Shahid Minar, with backdrop of Victoria Memorial. Tourists should also take the AC Tram ride , that operates from Esplanade Tram Depot / Station near the K C Das Outlet. The schedule keeps changing & sadly, nobody guides properly about this unique attraction. Even we missed this in spite of best efforts & finally found the location from where this ride commences, but it was too late. Currently Tourist AC Tram rides are available from Esplanade Tram Station - 3 times on Sunday & in the evening on Wed & Sat. Duration 90 - 120 minutes, depending on traffic & fare Rs 150.

Back in time.,WilliamWrawby,"Brigg, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,30-Jun-18,"I used the tram twice. Pushing and shoving are common to get on and off and few wait their turn but that is the way. They are not air conditioned but when moving, there is a breeze. Not all lines in the streets are operational - tracks have simply been left. Trams often travel against the flow of traffic but this is normal and the cars/vans/lorries/buses/rickshaws move aside for them. You can get on and off anywhere simply put out your arm but be prepared to run and jump on as sometimes the driver slows but does not stop.

The Heritage Transport of Kolkata,Kushal360,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,31-May-18,"I really love riding the heritage trams, esp. when I have some time at hand.

It may not be so convenient, like the AC buses plying on Kolkata streets (though some AC tourist trams may now be available), but they offer an experience with the heritage.

Known as Streetcars in the United States, trams saw their heydays in the early twentieth century, but then rapidly fell out of fashion as a rapid transit system. It is therefore a heritage, but not the most efficient carriage in Kolkata. b) The communists, before coming to power, protested against miniscule rises in the tram fare. That led the fares to be the minimum, facilitating cheap public transport, but hindering any infrastructural development. Only lately a few modernised trams are being employed, but most carriages still bear what is the old-world charm for some, and a dilapidated past for the others. c) Whether old or new, trams are extremely photogenic.

Happened to visit Kolkata after nearly 14 years, and a tram ride after nearly 20 years. was absolutely nostalgic. 

Took a ride from Gariahat to Tollygunje. The wait was long and tiring. Which is understandable, as the trams cannot match up to the FAST PACED expectations of regular commuters. Hence the frequency of trams is once every 30 minutes. 

The ride was fun, and the speed of the tram ensured that you could stare outside and observe and absorb a lot more of the city. Just brought back old memories. 

The ride is economical as well, as an 8 km ride only cost me Rs. 6 !!!!!

Trams are charming for people who come to Calcutta for the first, second , third time and even for people who keep coming to Kolkata again and again . 

Nowadays the local population has switched over to the metro or faster moving buses but still you will find school going children and the elderly referring to use the trams on the Limited routes which exist these days. 

Kolkata Trams have two compartments the first class and the second class the first class has got fans the second class does not have fans the best part is that you can Hop on and hop off if you are a child without having any fear of breaking bones since it runs on electricity Trance do not cause any pollution on the roads .

And when you are visiting a city having the first metro train of the country, & still running such heritage tram service, it's just an awesome feeling. And their affordable price makes them even better. I just wish they should continue to run for some more years. More",Dec-16

Very rare experience,RobinInfinities,"New Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,11-Jun-17,"You will find trams in very few cities. As far my knowledge goes Kolkata is the only city in India which has trams. 

It's really fun to ride tram. I have not got the chance to ride the new coaches have arrived. Previously they used to have two classes in two compartments. 
The first compartment was being called first class which used to have one old giant fan on the celling. 
In the second class there was no fan people use to have to depend on natural air flow during summers. 
And for these two classes fares were different no matter you ride in summers or in winters.

It's an emblem of Kolkata, if ever there was one. As service has disintegrated, the frequency of runs is down. You may face some frustration when a tram doesn't come as predicted.

So there is a minimal difference in the fare of the two compartments. The seats are wooden. It will all be a british era feeling and it gies at a very relaxed pace.

Beautiful but unmaintained piece of heritage,Sumit A,"Ghaziabad, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,16-Apr-17,"Trams are show stoppers in the city of Kolkata and transportation stoppers too. Literally, every single car has to literally stop and divert when a tram is travelling because they travel together alongside other vehicles of transportation. 

Why ride a tram ? 

This is an eternal piece of heritage which must be experienced, before its gone. 
If you've ample time to just relax, board a tram. They are TOO SLOW. 

Why not to ride a tram ? 

Too slow. 
Very Badly maintained. 

USEFUL TIPS / HACKS: 

Tram tickets are very cheap. So, don't miss the ride. Starts from 5 Rupees. 
Get first class tickets to board the coach attached to the engine, so you can look inside Driver's cabin.

No matter how ill maintained and slow these trams are, they are fun and an absolute delightful experience to ride. More",Jan-17

North Kolkata ( Esplanade-Great Eastern Hotel-BBD Bug-Jorasanko Thakur bari-Ganesh Talkies-Shova Bazar-Kumar Tuli-Bagbazar ... Old Kolkata route ). Another route ... Esplanade-Sahid Miner-Fort William-Race course-Hastings-Fancy Market-Khiddirpur. You may try for other routes also. You need to have 2-3 hrs for riding. It’s enjoyable for kids also.

On a previous trip to the city, a group of about 30 of us had chartered a tram, but there was nothing on the front to say so; intending passengers were most disgruntled at not being allowed to board an apparently virtually empty tram.

A fascinating slice of Calcutta's colonial history,sanjay_ska,"Greater Noida, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,28-Feb-16,"I lived in Kolkata a few years in the late 80s as a student. Earlier this year I visited Calcutta (I cannot get myself to call it Kolkata) with my wife and daughter. Ofcourse a ride on a tram was compulsory - before this fascinating slice of colonial era Calcutta rumbled into history. 

We took a short ride from near the new Howrah bridge to Esplanade - almost along the length Calcutta's green centre - also called the Maidan. The ride took us physically along the Fort William on our left and the Maidan on our right with a view of the skyline of buildings along Chowringhee Road. With its easy pace and the clang of bells which is still retained over the noisy horn - the tram also transported us back to a colonial era though the cars may have looked different. We imagined being drawn along the route by horses followed by rickety tramcars with the urgency of the tramcar for right of way proportional to the ringing of the bell by the tram driver.

Tram is the Kolkata's old tradition at effect.

These might to be the worst maintained trams in the world but you just have to ride one. It’s taking your life in your hands but it’s a wonder these old dears are still running.

LET'S CALL IT A DAY,Dilraj49,"Calcutta, West Bengal, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,30-May-15,"What used to be an essential part of the city's transport system has now become an eyesore due to total lack of care and maintenance. Effectively, its inability to serve its basic purpose (hardly anyone takes a ride on it these days) has made it practically redundant in today's context. Apart from being a white elephant (huge doses of subsidy are what it lives on), it has truly become a nuisance on the road especially after its erstwhile elevated tracks were brought down to the road levels. Its continuance, based on its historical association with the city and of course, its so-called pollution-free criterion (greatly supported by its Melbourne counterpart), does not stand to any reason if viewed in the light of economic considerations and / or utility. 
The only to let it survive would be to have short tracks between Esplanade and Kidderpore and perhaps, an economically feasible network in Salt Lake / New Town / Rajarhat. More",Jan-15

The Calcutta Tramways Company has come up with a singular concept — a mobile museum tram, christened Smaranika (memorablia). The Smaranika houses photographs of different kinds of trams down the ages, different tram tickets, badges, caps and others apparels worn by the conductors, along with different kinds of equipment that have been used from the bygone times. A section of this intriguing museum on wheels contains various references of the tram in Bengal’s literary and cultural scene. The references include the writings of Rabindranath Tagore, Sunil Gangopadhyay, Sharadindu Bandopadhyay and Bibhutibhusan Bandyopadhayay. Visitors can also sit and sip tea at a counter inside the tram, which mostly stands at the Esplanade depot of the CTC in central Kolkata. The Smaranika itself... Tram is the Kolkata's old tradition at effect. Kolkata is the only Indian city which maintains such rich heritage. The first tram rolled out on the tracks way back in February 28, 1873. A horse drawn tram system opened in January 1881 after a premature experiment in 1873 and a steam tramway line opened in 1882. Electric trams began plying on March 27, 1902 and by 1921 there were 56 km of track and 512 cars in service. Kolkata tramway provides a leisurely way of observing the historic parts of Kolkata and Sutanuti. 
SMARANIKA- THE UNIQUE TRAM MUSEUM 
The long and interesting history of this historic mode of transport is being presented in a unique fashion in the city. The Calcutta Tramways Company has come up with a singular concept — a mobile museum tram, christened Smaranika (memorablia). 

The Smaranika houses photographs of different kinds of trams down the ages, different tram tickets, badges, caps and others apparels worn by the conductors, along with different kinds of equipment that have been used from the bygone times. 

A section of this intriguing museum on wheels contains various references of the tram in Bengal’s literary and cultural scene. The references include the writings of Rabindranath Tagore, Sunil Gangopadhyay, Sharadindu Bandopadhyay and Bibhutibhusan Bandyopadhayay. 

Visitors can also sit and sip tea at a counter inside the tram, which mostly stands at the Esplanade depot of the CTC in central Kolkata. 

The Smaranika itself is an antique piece built in 1938, and renovated in the workshop of CTC. It is still operational. “This is the only archive depicting the history of an urban mode of transport.

For a tourist who just wants to ride trams without any clear agenda, the route can be a little hard to choose.

It is a must ride if you want to see Kolkata at a leisurely pace and be nostalgic.

Kolkata, a city of mixed blends of life and a history as eventful, proudly presents few things that can be experienced at many places all over the world but nowhere else other than this city in India. Metro Rail for many decades ran only in Kolkata until recently it has begun to run in the country's capital as well. Metro rail and tram are opposites, while the former is a high speed train that is most crowded during busy hours the trams on the other hand give you a relaxing, leisurely travel through the heart of the city.

Beautiful view of the Rangeet valley. Must Visit,iPreet19,"Navi Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,19-Feb-19,"Must visit due to the view of the Rangeet valley, However, the tea estate is closed during Dec to Mar, the same will be operational from April to June, and the Tea factory shows how the tea is made. 

Must Visit.",Feb-19
Too high price. PRICE IS TOO HIGH,srkkingfan,"Navi Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,14-Feb-19,Darjeeling is a best place to visit with big groups but when it comes to sightseeing. There are few things and Darjeeling government has kept too high prices for lot of things. Passenger ropeway price is too much and it is not good for big groups. Darjeeling has become very expensive as compared to other places and other cities. Sikkim and West bengal are now becoming expensive day by day. Government of sikkim and West bengal are not worth visiting these places because of the high prices. Visitors have to think twice or thrice. Very expensive place.,Feb-19
It’s great,Pooja_Vikesh,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,22-Jan-19,So ropeway is a good way to go top on the hill and get a really great view. But it was not under operation due to some reasons when we had had gone here in early January. It would have been working by now.,Jan-19
Mrs,arunadasandi,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,3-Jan-19,"It was out of order, another disappointment. Infact it was broken. What can I write when I couldn't got on it. Darjeeling was biggest disappointment of whole tour.",Dec-18
Closed indefinitely so don't bother,Herodotus888,"Sydney, Australia",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,19-Nov-18,We walked a long way to ride this ropeway/ cable car but it looks like it's closed for the foreseeable future. Probably a good thing given the state of it! I'm not sure that we would have trusted it anyway if it had actually been open. Looks dodgy.,Nov-18
North Point,Anshumanafsa,"Kurseong, India, Asia",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,1-Nov-18,Located near St. Joseph's College at North Point in Darjeeling....its actually one of the few touristy things worth doing in Darjeeling.,Oct-18
nice,ashishdeora123,"Jodhpur, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,15-Oct-18,small rope way not so big hardly take 10 minutes to reach and come back u can see whole city from rope way but if whether is bad cant see anything,Mar-18
Simple cable car,AthmaramP,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,11-Oct-18,Not so great cable car. small ride to and fro. Have been in better rides in south India. Just a small fun trip for kids to enjoy.,Oct-18
Non operational in Sep 2018,shajukutty,"Pune, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,16-Sep-18,"When we visited in Sep 2018, the Ropeway was not operational. Our enquiries yielded conflicting answers, the cabbie mentioned that it was due stalling of contract while at the hotel, they said some repair work is underway.",Sep-18
Need maintenance,amychat2000,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,31-Jul-18,Was out of service this monsoon and we were not lucky enough to gain the experience. The surrounding needs a little more maintenance.,Jul-18
Not so Exciting,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,15-Jul-18,"The Passenger Rope way is also called the Rangeet Valley Cable Car .Its a very short ride. 
Its a 20 minutes of ride one-way and 40 minutes overall. We can see a nice view of Darjeeling Tea Garden from above. There's hardly anything once you travel for 20 minutes as it becomes boring after a while. You will have to wait for at least 30-45 minutes in the queue before you actually take the ropeway. Good experience specially for first timers .At the other end, there are some small shops which sell Tea/ coffee/ snacks at nominal price. The place can have been skipped if one has already been to rope ways. More",Mar-18
What a view from the top!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,30-Jun-18,Ropeway was much important thing to do in Darjeeling. It gave a mismerizing view of Darjeeling Tea Garden.,Jun-18
Nice Ride,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,26-Jun-18,"Darjeeling Ropeway is a passanger ropeway between Darjeeling town and Ranjeet Valley. 
One of the tourist attractions in Darjeeling. 
The fare is very cheap and 6 people can sit in the cabin. 
Ride on Darjeeling Ropeway gives a great arieal view of tea gardens,rivers,temples and monastaries.",Jun-18
It was not working,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,25-Jun-18,We went there but found it to be out of service. It appeared to be average location or attraction whatever you want to call it.,Jun-18
Rangeet Valley Cable Car!!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,21-Jun-18,The Passenger Ropeway is also called the Rangeet Valley Cable Car and is a major tourist attraction as it gives an aerial view of the scenic beauty of Darjeeling.Its a very short ride.,Mar-18
Not so exiting,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,8-Jun-18,We could not ride this. This was on maintenance. We heard some people died by an accident. It is difficult to keep confidence on such mechanical thing.,Jun-18
Rope way,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,2-Jun-18,Actually this is the best way to see the Darjeeling but service is too slow and the waiting time to get the ticket is too long. So its better to avoid it.,Jun-18
Good Ropeway to give a decent view around,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,29-May-18,This ropeway was about 2 Km away from Darjeeling and near the Tenzing Rock. A must do activity for enjoyment as one can see the whole valley underneath.,Nov-17
Rudimentary Stuff.,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,28-May-18,Good for the first feel of a ropeway. Firstly the pod has only standing space. Secondly the service is slow and waiting for getting tickets long. (It took us one hour). The only redeeming feature is that you get a view of the city.,May-18
Awesome view,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,17-May-18,Recharge 117 rupees per person for the Rope way and it's an awesome experience to see the entire Darjeeling from the ropeway Darjeeling.,May-18
Nice Views of Tea Plantations,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,2-May-18,The rope way in Darjeeling gives one a nice views of tea plantations and surrounding mountain ranges. The flip side is that one needs to wait at least 1-2 hours for your turn to come by to get the ride.,Feb-18
Passable,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,28-Apr-18,The ropeway is good for kids and people who have never been on one. Didn't appeal to me. Just a point to tick off in the list,Apr-18
Awsome Experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Apr-18,The best ropeway I have ever experienced. You will get great view from the top. The rope way is normally very crowded. Will have to wait for atleast one hour. But it is worth .,Jan-18
Amazing View from the top,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,19-Apr-18,Probably one of the longest ropeway in the country where you will start at 7000ft and reach 800 ft and back,Mar-18
ropeway on high altitude,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,4-Apr-18,It is one the best ropeway in india which i have visited. You get to see nice scenes while travelling in it,Apr-18
Not worth Waiting and Money,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,3-Apr-18,"You need to spend 3-4 hours to finish this rope way where you need to spend 1 hour for tickets and 2 hours in Queue and 30-40 min Rope way. (Ticket price is Rs. 200/- per person) 
Taxis will charge for Waiting also. After all this, Views are not so great in 5 km distance compared to Gangtok's rope way which is by far least priced and beautiful. 
Not Worth in Any way.",Mar-18
Ropeway,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,30-Mar-18,"A nice scenic ride on the Rungeet valley ropeway, with an awesome view of the tea estate below. A forty minute ride up and down will set you back just Rs 200/ head. But be prepared to stand in a long queue at both ends of the ropeway. Depending on the crowds, you might have to set aside half a day for this activity.",Mar-18
Nice views but a bit boring after a while..,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,23-Mar-18,"The view is amazing from the top but as you get to the bottom, you almost just want it to be over already. We had to share with another family of 4 so it was quite packed as well.",Mar-18
Nice ride,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,22-Mar-18,Just for INR 200 return you get 30 mins ride which offers great view. Note it has big queue for a ticket so plan as per ( 30 mins waiting min),Mar-18
View of tea plantations,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,19-Mar-18,"What we liked best about the ropeway was the view of the beautiful green tea plantations below.And after we got off,we immediately bought some Darjeeling tea.",Dec-17
Not so great!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,19-Mar-18,20 minutes of ride one-way and 40 minutes overall. There's hardly anything once you travel for 20 minutes as it becomes boring after a while. You will have to wait for at least 30-40 minutes in the queue before you actually take the ropeway. They charge INR 100/person. Avoidable!,Mar-18
Very beautiful view of tea estates,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,16-Mar-18,You can have a very good view of tea estates while sitting in cable car. There is a tea factory as well which can be seen.,Mar-18
Good experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,15-Mar-18,"40 minute rope-way experience.Certainly the longest Rope-way experience for me. Amazing view of Valley which is fully covered with Tea plants.If you are in Darjeeling, I definitely recommend this place to visit once.",Mar-18
Overview of tea gardens,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,12-Mar-18,Ropeway ride was looking to be scary but it had gradual descent and ascent. We could see the phases of tea crops. Got down and returned,Feb-18
Holiday,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,10-Mar-18,"I went in the first week of March and waiting period was around half an hour each in both the sides. View from the ropeway was stunning. Fare for adults is Rs 200 up and down, for children upto 7 year it is Rs 100. There is not much option to do in the downhill except for few small shops selling tea and snacks.",Mar-18
Review of Ropeway,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,8-Mar-18,"Good experience specially for first timers and / children. Parking of vehicles is little tricky but one can find the place. Not very crowded and pretty systematically organised. 
One gandola takes six people at a time so a lot depends on the company you get, or you can buy six tickets and take the whole gandola for your own disposal. 
The ropeway will take you down where you will be asked to dismount and have a look at tea estate. One can buy local tea as well during the halt. 
Overall around 40 minutes of circuit.",Mar-18
Great view of Darjeeling tea gardens,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,6-Mar-18,"We were there in the month of February, so, contrary to perception of long wait, there was hardly any que. In fact we had an entire car for all the there of us. It takes around 20 minutes to reach the other end, in between offering a breathtaking view of tea gardens and the valley below. Did some tea tasting at the other end then came back to the top again.",Mar-18
Amazing feel,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,4-Mar-18,What a view n expirience...totally amazing n wow...if one wants to feel the aireal view of the valley then this the spot for u..,Feb-18
Thrilling experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,27-Feb-18,"While we travel through this ropeway, suddenly the power was cut, and we stuck for few moments. Those moments are best thrilling experience in my life. As that moment we were very frightened but later on we all laughed at each other.",Mar-17
Smaller tour time would be great,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,24-Feb-18,"Up and down journey took almost 40 minutes of time which become a bit long. At the same time you need to share the car with other people which makes the journey further uncomfortable. Apart from these two factors, the journey was very enjoyable. Tea estate is just below the line and you will get a clear view of the place.",Feb-18
Views of Darjeeling tea valleys but does not offer much,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,22-Feb-18,"The place is one of the longest railways in India and among major tourist attractions in Darjeeling. It offers splendid views of tea gardens across the valley. Price is Rs. 200/- per person and it is 45 minutes to and fro. 

In terms of other activities, nothing much is offered. At the other end, there are some small shops which sell Tea/ coffee/ beer/ snacks at nominal price. 

The place can be skipped if one has already been to rope ways.",Feb-18
Great way to enjoy,Anshumanafsa,"Kurseong, India, Asia",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,18-Feb-18,This ride is open from 10am to 4pm. The cost of a ticket is Rs 200 per head and the whole journey takes about 45 minutes. The views are breathtaking. The start off point is located about 3 km from the taxi stand. Near St Joseph's North Point.,Nov-17
"Old time charm, but noting outstanding if you have done ropeway before",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,13-Feb-18,"With a fare of Rs 200 per head and a round trip of close to 45 mins, it is one of the longest rope-way I have traveled. It is takes you over the Darjeeling tea gardens to a point where you have to get down. You can choose to walk into one of the gardens for photo ops, and then come back to take the ride back to the starting point. There is a small mountain cafe which I found to be good to sit and sip a hot cup of tea. 

There is a huge waiting time if you go in the season, and a narrow lane to the starting point so parking could be a big issue. So unless it is your first time with the Rope-way you can avoid it during peak season time, I would however not discourage from taking the ride if anyone is interested! More",Feb-18
Scenic view,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,7-Feb-18,"Main attraction is it is very long ropeway and take around 40 minutes for up and down ride, also it is very cheap (200 only) 

it will give immense view of tea gardens, whole darjeeling. complete memorizing journey for 40 minutes",Feb-18
Nice view of tea gardens,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,6-Feb-18,This ropeway gives a food view of the tea gardens and is good value at Rs 200 return. It takes about 20 minutes each way.,Jan-18
Amazing ride through the famous darjeeling tea valley,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,31-Jan-18,"This is the lengthiest ropeway ride compared to other hill stations. 
Ropeway provides an amazing experience but the view is same of the tea garden. 
Kids would enjoy a lot, you can take a small halt at the tea garden before taking return journey. 

A must recommend for those with family and kids.",Jan-18
Awesome scenic view,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,30-Jan-18,"Passenger ropeway is an awesome place to visit. The scenic view is awesome. The ropeway passes through the tea gardens, hills and tall trees. Viewing the natural greenery from the top is really a heart wining experience. A memorable place to visit.",Oct-17
Below average,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,27-Jan-18,Does not give any good view. You have to wait in long queues for the ticket as well as to get on the cable car. It has nothing at the destination it leaves you on just a bunch of vendors selling snacks and surprisingly serving Liquor. Overall an average experience.,Jan-18
Centre of attraction,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,23-Jan-18,"This tourist place is one of the hottest attraction among tourists. Here you can enjoy the ride of ropeway, this ride will take about an hour where you can enjoy the scenic beauty of the surrounding nature. So this is a must place to visit if you are planning to visit Daejeeling.",Dec-17
Rope Way,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,17-Jan-18,"Good Views start even before boarding the cable car. You have a wonderful view of the snow capped himalayas before geting into the cable car. The views of the valley are wonderful once you are in. Kids will like this ride, don't get down at the bottom of the valley unless you have time to go around and would like to have a walk in the tea gardens.",Apr-17
Currently not working.,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,10-Jan-18,"Currently the Passenger Ropeway was not working, got an update from the local that it has been down from few days now.",Dec-17
Lovely,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,8-Jan-18,"Neither highest nor longest, this ropeway may be slowest. Passing over vast tea gardens, it presents panoramic view of western Sikkim hills. Good experience for kids, youngsters.",Jan-18
Ropeway,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,7-Jan-18,it was fun activities when we where in ropeway car .entire Darjeeling view was cleared. we enjoyed a lot,Jan-18
Not working since last 4-5 months according to locals...,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,4-Jan-18,"we went especially to enjoy the rope-way ride but unfortunately we came to know that it was closed since last 4-5 months and hopefully it will start functioning again after maintenance as soon as possible. 
So if are going Darjeeling especially to enjoy Rope-way ride so please confirm weather it is functional or not.",Dec-17
Good,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,30-Dec-17,Like any other ropeway. You can take a single or two way ticket and zoom over the tree tops and darjeeling city.. Nothing mush to see from it. It was afun ride.,Nov-17
Closed,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,6-Dec-17,We walked to this place and found it closed. You need to check in advance before going. Would have been an wonderful experience. Perhaps next time if the owners can get it going again. Seems some problem with licence??,Dec-17
A good attraction but immensely wasted,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,17-Nov-17,"This is how pathetic the Govt run machinery can ruin a beautiful tourist attraction. This is no place to compare to the Cable Car experience in Langkawi, but a lot of scope for improvement to attract a lot tourists visiting Darjeeling. 
Firstly the roads leading to this place is so clumsy. Traffic helped us reach this place in about 2 hrs for a distance of nearly 3kms from the town center. After reaching the ticketing counters we realised that the queue was longer than all Darjeeling Mountain trains connected end to end. 
The price of ride is modest but for the experience overall, including time taken to get a ticket, board the ride and the amenities at either ends of the ropeway, this is too much. 
Yes, there is tourists from all places visiting here to have a ropecar experience, but shouldn't we ensure there are many happy faces? 

The ride was a nice experience and wasn't as scary as in Langkawi or elsewhere. If you are lucky the clouds would allow you few glimpses of the snowcaps faraway. 

Make sure your bladders are emptied before visiting this place, unless you have no problems with a stinky public urinal. If you have your own food stuff, there is a small sit-out at the other end to spend a few mins before you board your ride back. 

Remember the ropecar is closed every 19th of the month for maintenance. More",May-17
Breathtaking View of Tea Garden and Himalayan Mountain Range,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,9-Nov-17,"We had been to Darjeeling Ropeway wherein we have passed above tea gardens. It is really fantastic and they drove us to from the starting point up to garden. 
Tea Garden Workers were singing songs and were cheering to us. Speed of Ropeway is very moderate and one can easily enjoy photo shooting.",Dec-16
Darjeeling Ropeway,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,8-Nov-17,This is one of the longest Rope way we had in our travel so far. It takes through approximate 5 kilometers to and fro . Had fun. Good to visit here. Children would enjoy . It ride through the top of team gardens ... A nice experience.,Apr-17
Scary at first.,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,28-Oct-17,This rope way ride is not for the faint hearted as at first one would tend to get a bit scared with the creaking of the cable car when it exits the starting point and when it stalls a couple of times enroute. It however offers a breathtaking view of the tea estates deep below in the valley. Worth a trip.,Oct-17
Adventure,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,10-Oct-17,The Darjeeling Ropeway a way of transport which is definitely not for the faint-hearted. 4 people are seated in a small glass cabin and it starts moving at a high inclination. The view from the top is mesmerizing.,Jun-17
Ropeway,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,26-Sep-17,"Darjeeling Rope way is the over view of city for 3 km of ropeway u can see almost the whole town, its 45 min up n down journey.",Jun-17
Ropeway,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,25-Sep-17,I go in dargiling... When I reach darziling I saw ropeways... I am very for this I decided and go .very happy.,Sep-17
Bird's Eye view of the City...,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Sep-17,"It's a cable car that takes you long distance over the land of Darjeeling. Gives you bird's eye of the area, which is indeed fascinating. It's a bit costly but still worth a visit.",Mar-17
Nothing Spectacular,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,14-Sep-17,This is a poorly managed service provided by the authorities.The cable cars are can accomodate 4 pax each. The view of a tea estate below and its surroundings from the point of a birds eye view is not that spectacular.The cable cars don't appear to be well maintained and there are no visible helpers to assist you board the cars.There was also a long queue waiting to use the cable cars and we had to wait about 20 minutes. If you don't have the time you can give this a miss.,Feb-17
"View is Breathtaking, but UNSAFE Ride",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,13-Sep-17,"As captioned, the depth of the cable car ride is pretty high, but each cable car, which can accommodate 4 persons are very unstable and uncomfortable. 

The view from the cable car is palpably panoramic. 

But, as mentioned it is very poorly maintained and few couple of times, the cable of the ropeways had snapped, causing accidents.",May-17
A good option to glaze at the Tea Gardens,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,30-Aug-17,Do it if you have not done a ropeway before. The ropeway cars are not the best as most of the viewing glass scratched so you will have to open the windows. The view of the Tea Gardens below is great.,Apr-17
As to be expected,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,14-Aug-17,"We didn't have to wait at all, straight into a car for ourselves without having to share. 

Not much to do down the bottom but i enjoyed the ride as we rode over the tea workers cleaning the tea fields. 

Worth doing.",Mar-17
Unique Experience - In Ropeway / Cable Car,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,1-Aug-17,"If any one is visiting Darjeeling for two days - One must try the ropeway which is situated in a striking distance from Cab Stop. 

You don't have to pay 500rs or so as some local drivers ask. You can go there in a shared taxi with just Rs 30 per person. 

Negative Point : You have to stand there in queue for a long time. May be an hour or so before you get your turn. 

It takes you through hill scapes and beautiful tea garden beneath and after 15 minutes you get to a place where you need to deboard. 

There are many sitting joints or restaurants and one must try Wai Wai and Hot Coffee if going around Oct to Feb. 

Superb Weather. Must Go place. Experience the Nature from your naked eyes. More",Feb-17
Nice city view,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,27-Jul-17,We had to wait in a long queue for an hour but it was worth waiting as we had a very nice ride and view from the cable car,May-17
First cable car experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,25-Jul-17,"One of the must go place in Darjeeling. The only negative thing is the long queue, but u can shorten the waiting time by selecting a weekday and a off peak time to go there. Scenic view was awesome as had to passed through the tea gardens, hills and long trees. Ticket price was reasonable though i can't remember the amount. If u want to experience speedy airflow then have to open both the windows but have to be careful if u have kids with u.",Mar-17
Excellent view,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,6-Jul-17,"The ropeway in Darjeeling gives an excellent view of the tea gardens beneath.. Must Enjoy the ride. 
Watch my vlog on the same on YouTube. 
The Indian Travel Diaries.",Aug-16
Beautiful views but long queue,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,6-Jul-17,"This is a must-do in Darjeeling. The cable car moves above tea gardens giving a very beautiful view of the scenery. We visited in May month so it was a bit cloudy which added more beauty to the scenery. Just take care of one thing. This place has a very long queue. We had to wait for almost 2 hours after purchasing the tickets. So visit here only when you have much time left. At the place where the cable car drops us we can have a walk in the tea garden. There is no time limit for this walk, just make sure you return to the point where you were dropped before the closing time. After the walk the cable car takes us to the starting point. 

The place has small eateries beside it with the food ranging from 'roti sabji' to momos. More",May-17
Ropeway,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,30-Jun-17,"Abut one hour rope-way ride to and fro. beautiful tea gardens and hill view. No, of cars are less considering traffic.",May-17
Rope way,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,21-Jun-17,Rope ways are always exciting. Nothing exclusive about this. The traffic during season is bad. Also long queues so needs lots of time,May-17
Slowest ropeway In India,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,20-Jun-17,"We were very excited to visit the darjeeling ropeway but standing in the queue for nearly 2 hours, waiting for our turn to come, shattered our excitement. People were getting into the line and there was nobody to supervise. There were only 11 trams and the only procedure was very slow. The view from the tram was good but the long wait put us off.",May-17
awesome experience in ropeway,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,18-Jun-17,we have enjoyed in ropeway with family. Its worth to opt this and you can see tea garden too. It give phi nominal experience about Darjelling. There is less no of trolley so will take time for your turn.,Jun-17
The longest ropeway i ever travelled,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,18-Jun-17,"Ropeway is indeed the longest I ever travelled it's one way distance is about 2.5 kilometers and it goes above lovely tea gardens which is really scenic, the worrisome? part is there is long waiting queue during peak season. We had to wait for about two and a half hours for our turn though it was during summer holidays hope during other time the waiting time is much less",Jun-17
Poorly managed during peak season,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,17-Jun-17,"If not for my 3 year old, I have never in my life waited in-line for 3-hours [no exaggeration] to get a scenic 20 min ride. The authorities need to get this sorted by issuing time-bound tickets and letting people book in advance.",May-17
Good but long queue.,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,14-Jun-17,It was good experience. But we lost 2.5 hrs becoz of long queue. Number of cables should increase...,Jun-17
Unique Experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,10-Jun-17,"Veiw of tea garden visible from Roapway Cabin, lot of greenry spreded over landscapes, Sit & relax to see the Beauty in cabin and go with memorable experience.",Apr-17
Good view of Darjeeling valley,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,6-Jun-17,Better come early morning as there is much rush takes around 2 hrs in line ride is 35 min up and down.,May-17
Must try,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,6-Jun-17,The Darjeeling ropeway is must visit item.You get an excellent birds eye view of vast tea gurdeen.It is about up down 5 km journey taking about 45 minutes.,May-17
Patience needed,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,5-Jun-17,Situated just on top of st. Joseph school is this popular ropeway giving a magnificent view of the hills and the city. But alas you have to stand in long queues one after the other and lose the charm of the ripest ride. Very poorly managed ticket counter entry and exit points. May take take 3 to 4 hours to complete a trip and thus lose the day and miss other points of sight seeing. May be going early morning would help.,Jun-17
Best roapway available in darheeling,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,31-May-17,This place a must see for every one who visit darjeeling. Great experience and view. Roapway is also very long way in lowecost.,Apr-17
Absolutely breathtaking even after long queue,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,31-May-17,"After a long queue we had our turn. Just before we started our journey downhill, the cloud (no not fog, cloud) covered most of the hill top and we literally traveled through the cloud! My kids loved it to the bits.",Mar-17
Thoroughly Enjoyable,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,30-May-17,"We took a ride with 4 adults and 3 children. All of us enjoyed it. Very scenic and serene. 
Please reach the counter by 9.30 to 9.45 to avoid long queue and waiting. The ride itself is about 30-40 minutes and lovely.",May-17
Nothing special,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,27-May-17,"Ropeway is not very special. You have to wait for atleast 2.5 hours before you get a chance to sit in the cabin! It's a 5km two and fro ride and takes approximately 45 minutes. Down into the valley there is nothing fascinating. 
Ticket price is very high ?175/person 
It's just an experience.. That's it!",May-17
Hang on in sky,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,18-May-17,The Rope way ride is excellent. One can see Tea Garden on sloping ground and view of Darjeeling skyline. Ride is smooth and no worries. However the Q during waiting period is very irritating. Why they don't give no and time so that people can come by spending time at good place. Small seating arrangement is required for elders. Once you start riding it is awesome.,May-17
Hovering above tea estates,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,17-May-17,The ropeway ride takes you above tea estates like Tukvar. The orderly greens and terraced hills with a Buddha statue on view from above mark the journey. Occasionally the flying birds look askance at the riders in a trolley box!,Jan-17
Good scenic view.,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,17-May-17,The Darjeeling ropeway has been there for a while and the last time I visited it before this was probably 15yrs ago. The ride is approx 20min 1 way. The ticket costs ~150 INR per person. The ropway offers an amazing view of the tea garden below and the mighty Mt Kanchanjunga in front of you while going down. A must if you visit Darjeeling.,Jan-17
8-9kms of Ride over the hills,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,16-May-17,"Beauty best described. This ropeway is approx 8-9kms which takes 40mins. You need to take a ticket worth Rs.175 and stand in queue for your turn. But all this is totally worth it. The cable cars are well maintained and the scenic beauty you get to see once on the ride is marvelous. Lush green hills, tea gardens are visible and the expanse of Darjeeling in general. Must visit for all.",May-17
Best view of the valley in Darjeeling,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,16-May-17,"The ropeway is just like any other on a hill station, but the views of the valley is really a worth. The tea gardens on the hills are clearly seen from the rope way trolley. The queue remains long, its better to get there early say by 10 am itself to ensure fast return, the ropeway i s a bit too long, like you go down the valley and return back to the top without a stop or stepping out so though its exciting for the first round the return trip may be equally boring. So give it a try if you have atleast1-2 hour or just skip.",May-17
A long rope-way with awesome views,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,16-May-17,"Situated close to the Darjeeling zoo, it took us about 2 hours in queue to get to the cable car but once we started the journey we knew it was worth the wait. Vast stretches of Tea garden and misty hills was a treat to watch. The ticket is Rs 175/-. You have to embark at the other end and return in another cable car.(Can spend time on the other side before returning)",May-17
It is a nice experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,16-May-17,"The Rope way station starts from 10 am and unless and until you reach by at least 9:30, it is going to be a long wait. It takes Rs.175 for a to and fro journey. The experience is awesome though the speed could have been faster. Only problem I found was, once you reach the other end, you have to get down from the cable car and wait in queue again for the return journey.",Apr-17
Best Experience at Darjeeling,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,15-May-17,"When we entered the rope way, the weather was foggy, creating a beautiful view of the Tea gardens, as well as Darjeeling. However, the real fun began during the return ride, when it actually started raining, with our cable car completely surrounded by clouds with very little visibility. It was the best experience of our Darjeeling trip.",Apr-17
Good lengthy rope way,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,11-May-17,"Nicely maintained. 

Accessibility to the ropeway station is a problem because it requires a walk through a steep steps. Elders will find it very much difficult",May-17
Wow see to believe the beauty of queen of hills,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,5-May-17,"While depending on the number of tourists it may take from an hour or more for you to get into the cable car, it is a must see experience in Darjeeling",Apr-17

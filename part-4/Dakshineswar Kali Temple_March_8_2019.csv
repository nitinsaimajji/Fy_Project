Hm....it is interesting,lendvain,"Little Clacton, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,20-Feb-19,"To be honest I was rushed around by a guide, but even if I'd wonder alone wouldn't make a difference. 
I went to see the temple at sunset...still don't know why coz you can't see the difference between sun up or sun down (maybe I missed something...?) 
The 'church' is very small, only one door let you see in, not going in as monks and holy man sitting at the door. Plus sooo many people want a glimpse of the holy Kali, it is a big elbow fight to get a bit closer. 
My guide took me around the small yards and constantly told me what to do with the bunch of flowers he put in my hands. 
I had a blessing, cost as much as you want to give him, but when I got out a RS100 he made a face. No comment 
When gonished the tour he wanted my to buy more flowers for RS200. Told him no since it was my last day. Wanted to give him a little pocket money but he run away, chasing other tourists.

Every half an hour there is ferry service from both sides from 7.30 a.m. to 7.30 p.m. 

This famous temple was constructed by Rani Rashmoni. In 1847 she wished to go to Kashi along with her relatives and servants in twenty-four boats. The day preceding her travel, Kali Mata appeared to her in a dream and asked her to install Her idol in a temple and get her Blessings. So Rashmoni purchased twenty acres of land in Dakshineswaram village from an Englishman named John Hestie and completed the temple construction in 1855. On the holy day of Jagannath Deva Snana Yatra on May 31st, 1855 the idol of Jagadeeswari Kalimata Thakurani was installed. Sri Ramkumar Chattopadhyaya served as the temple priest till his demise in 1856. His brother Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa later served as the priest till 1866. Rani Rahmoni Lived for five years and nine months after starting the temple. She died on 18th February, 1861. Her shrine has been later added near the entrance to the temple yard. 

Perched on an elevated platform the main Kali temple reveals the gracious form of Bhavatarini made of shining black basalt stone decked with gold brocade standing on white marble statue of Shiva in lying position. Both these idols are installed on a thousand-petalled lotus-seat made of silver. A narrow covered verandah serves as the audience chamber attached to the sanctum. A spacious Natamandir(dancing hall) is seen in front of the temple. Twelve east-facing Shiva Mandirs (shrines) with holy Shiva Lingas made of black stone with idols of Nandis facing them are seen on both sides of corridor near the bank of the Hoogly River. At the head of the Hoogly ghat there is a roofed terrace to view the river front. Just beyond the last Shiva Mandir Sri Ramakrishna used to live with Sarada Devi in a music room called Nahabath. He stayed here nearly for thirty years till his death in 1866. 

n the northeastern side of this temple complex one can see the Radhakanta shrine where 21 ½ inch Krishna’s idol with 16 inch Radha’s idol are seen on a silver throne. The Panchavati (five sacred trees) garden is located very close to the temple. The old fig tree, the last remaining tree of Panchavati trees, is still seen. Here Sri Ramakrishna used to meditate. 

The visiting hours are from 6.00 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. and from 3.00 to 8.30 p.m. every day. In summer (April to September) the temple closes at 9.00 p.m. On Tuesdays and Fridays the temple is very much crowded. The whole temple beams with festive atmosphere with illumination, with ringing bells, blowing conchs and ululating piercing cries of Bengali women with shouts of excitement and devotion. On every Amavasya day the temple is beautifully decorated and evening aarti is performed. This temple graced by Sri Ramakrishna’s holy presence makes one feel his deep devotion to Kali Ma. Many newly married couples and family members come here to receive the benedictions of the Universal Mother. More",Nov-18

Fortunately, I reside near Dakshinesar Kali Temple. During the last four decades, I frequently visited the holy shrine, considered as one of the largest Hindu temple complexes in India. 

Location 
Just at eastern bank of river Ganges, approx. 12 km north of Kolkata city of West Bengal State, connected by rail through Dakshineswar Railway Station and by road through frequent vehicular transport. Recently, a beautiful Skywalk has been installed from rail / road junction to main gate of the temple complex, to avoid traffic jam and smooth access of pilgrims. 

History 
The temple was built by Rani Rashmoni during 1847-1855 in 25 acre of land at a cost of Rs. 9.00 lacs. After death of the priest, the responsibility was shouldered to his brother Gadadhar. He came from native land and started living there with his pious wife Sarada Devi. His simplicity, dedication and divine power turned him to an incarnation, Shri Ramkrishna. Once a young atheist came to judge his superiority. But the priest’s profound depth and faith in God overwhelmed him and subsequently changed his life as Swami Vivekananda. 

Architecture 
South facing, three storeyed, main temple is of Bengali “Nava Ratna” (nine spires) style. It stands on platform to access by stairs. The idol of Goddess Kali stands on the chest of Lord Shiva, both being on a silver lotus with thousand petals. 

Temple complex 
Apart from this beautiful temple, the complex contains 12 identical Shiva Temples in a row, other temples, heritage buildings, Panchabati (five trees) Garden, Bathing Ghat, Trustee Office, flower / Prasad arcade, eateries, large car parking area etc. 

Visit 
The temple is visited by huge number of pilgrims every day,. ""Kalpataru"" festival in winter attracts lacs of pilgrims. Temple is open from 05.30 to 10.30 and 16.30 to 19.30 hrs. No holidays, no entry fees, no dress code, no cast restriction. It is absolutely free from any unwanted guidance, supremacy of Pandas (priests) or monetary demand from any corner. One can offer Puja standing in queue, may visit Trustee Office for donation against authentic acknowledgement, or roam aimlessly in the serene compound. Pilgrims may also take a short ferry ride over Ganges, enjoy the riverside view with twin bridges atop, reach western bank, and visit Belur Math, the international Head Quarter of Ramkrishna Mission, founded by Swami Vivekananda. 

Conclusion 
Dakshineswar Kali Temple welcomes all people to come, feel the glorious past, enjoy the peaceful environment, blessed with divine love and return with sweet memory. More",Nov-18

You buy the Puja Thali which can be for as little as a Rs.10 as well. Stand in queue, offer your prayers, sit in meditation, round the Shiva Lingas, watch the fishes in the temple pond, fill Ganges water from the Ghat and gaze at the wonderful beauty of the river and the bridge.

I recommend going to temple early morning. Make it a point to reach by 5:45AM to have a hassle free darshan.

Also wish that more greenery could be added, to impart the serene atmosphere, and hide the stone clad surroundings. It would cool the area also. 

The temple complex, as before, is well maintained, and carries one back in history to reverential heights. Also since now a well timed and systematized ferry service is available across the river, a visit to the adjoining Belur complex is a must to complete the pilgrimage.

Temple is nice spacious neat n clean. The deity is revered and the moment you see her you feel blessed. There wasn't much queue at 7am, so that is a nice time to visit But the priests are in the lookout for every opportunity to ask for money. They dont accept your offerings to the diety unless its accompanied with some notes. The offerings are literally thrown at the diety and i am sure it is then picked up and sent to the same shops where it was bought from, so that it can be resold to other visitors.

When he thought I was mature enough, he told me one day: ""This is a place where almost everyone associated to the Renaissance of Bengal in the nineteenth century has been, at least for once. Perhaps the stone you are standing on has the footprints of Vivekananda, or Tagore, or Netaji Subhash. Be thrilled, feel the aura: you too are a witness of the religious, intellectual, and cultural milieu that this temple has been hosting for long"".

That perhaps was the only sore experience. WE had to walk quite a distance to the shrine. As usual, there were huge crowd, but we found it very orderly. The place was not spic and span but an effort was being made to keep it so. We were not pestered by any Pandas. We could have the darshan very peacefully after standing for

This is quite the trek for a 45 minute visit through a few layers of security. I only recommend this if you have a significant amount of time and/or you are Hindu. 

From a tourist’s point of view: 

After arriving, you’ll want to go to the left side of the temple for a few photos, then either leave shoes, cameras, and cell phones with a driver or check them at the giant desk. 

You’ll see a few lines around the main temple. Just get in the shorter one, they all go into the temple. Everyone is scurried along, so try to stand towards the outer part of the line out of respect and to take in the experience of prayers and offerings in front of you. 

The smaller shrines are simple and nice to see. You can also get great views of the river. 

After that, you’re all done!

We were at Adyapith in 10 mins and enjoyed the Mangal arati and bhajans. Clean and well maintained temple complex. It was a lovely feeling as dawn broke gradually. At 5.40 am, we were back to Dakshineswar Kali temple. We went and sat on the stairs of the courtyard.. few devotees, clean, disciplined environment and a cool early morning breeze refreshing us. The door to the garbha griha (sanctum sanctorum) opened at 6.00 am and we offered our prayers to the resplendent Ma Bhabatarini (Kali).

Terrible security guards inside the Holy Shrine spoils the legacy,Urmihhi,Long Island Cit,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,9-Jul-17,"The Kali Temple is a fascinating place to visit. Kali is to me the ultimate empowerment of the woman and the depiction of the Goddess is a great attribute to all womankind. The temple was set up by visionaries who loved humanity over religion. The settings by the Ganges makes it picturesque. However, security settings have converted the temple into something less of what it actually signifies. The male guard with the moustache inside the main shrine likes to push women. The Goddess will sure punishment him one day, maybe he will loose his filthy hands one day. The priests are the greedy and love your cash n stash. My son had offered Swiss chocolates for offerings and he put it in his pocket without even taking it to the deity. It is a commercial place and sadly my Goddess is being used to mint money. However, the temple is not clean. And no special access for the sick n elderly. No phones or bags allowed. Shoes to be kept outside in stores where you can buy stuff for offering the Goddess Kali. I love this temple for the Goddess and the people associated with it, Rani Rashmoni,Ramkrishna ,Sarada Ma and Swamiji. Parking is available.

As we reached the stairs of the main temple, I started to feel real change inside myself. It was becoming more and more peaceful and humble. At the end of the stairs we assembled the pooja basket and lighted the incense sticks. We finally reached the last door behind which the magnificient deity of Maa Kali can be witnessed. It was one of the most revered sights that I have seen till now. Maa was divine. My hands clasped, my head bowed down and my heart felt liberated and at peace. 

I would have liked to stayed back more but had to leave to give way to others. There are other temples also in the courtyard as well as a big hall where devotees can sit and pray facing the main temple. We offered our prayers in the Shiva temple and spent some time amid the beautiful structures all around. The air itself seemed to have become clearer and purified in the vicinity. The whole temple area has been constructed keeping in mind both architectural excellence and spirituality in high regards. Everything is impressive. 

After sometime, we left the temple using a different gate and reached the banks of river Ganga. There was a huge staircase constucted to reach the holy waters. It was slowly becoming quite crowded. We spent some time here and then moved on. 

We also spent some time to bow down our heads and reflected back on our history in front of the houses of Maa Sharda and Ramkrishna Paramhans. It is now being maintained for darshan to devotees. 

There is another open market outside the temple from where we bought some bengali bangles, stonewares, pictures of temple and other religious items. The prices are okay, but you need to know how to bargain a bit. Some food stalls were also there. We tried some of the phuchkas (panipuri).

The crowd is quite a bit more on Saturdays, Sundays and other holidays and Holy days. So, be prepared to spend quite some time here. 

Apart from the main temple, there are temples dedicated to Lord Shiva as well as shrines dedicated to Sarada Devi and Ramakrishna, 

You can also relax on any of the numerous ""ghats"" along the River Ganges and see the beautiful sunset. 

Note: Mobiles, cameras, bags, shoes are not allowed inside the main temple complex. More",Mar-17

A heavenly experience...,sourav2012,Canada,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,11-Apr-17,"It's an experience beyond any review or feedback. It's a must visit for those who want to have a darshan at one of the holiest Kali Temples near Kolkata. 

The temple complex consists of a large courtyard surrounding the temple, with rooms along the boundary walls. There are twelve shrines dedicated to Shiva along the river, a temple to Radha-Krishna, a bathing ghat on the river, a shrine dedicated to Rani Rashmoni. Beside the last of the Shiva temples, is where Ramakrishna Dev spent a considerable part of his life. 

It's one of better managed temples I have ever come across and a visit to the place, gives an amazing feeling of peace and power at the same time, despite the crowd at times. 

Mind it, it's not in Kolkata. It's in the northern suburbs of Kolkata. However, it's very well connected through roads and rail. It's soon going to get metro connection in the next 1-2 years. So, commuting is not difficult, but for those visiting the city for the first time, it has to be planned well. The temple complex has got a huge parking area, so one can go there in their private/ hired vehicles. 

You can spend time at the temple courtyard, watch ''aarti'' in the evening or even spend some time near the river front. A boat ride across the river to Belur Math, is a wonderful experience. More",Aug-16

Nothing special,magnumauthor,"London, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,8-Apr-17,"The journey by boat from Belur Math to Dakshineswar was more interesting then the temple itself.

The temple is not that old but a nice design. 

It's nice sitting by the ghats and people watch for a while. 

Tip: if you intend on going to Dakshineswar after visiting Belur Math, be aware that it's quite a way from the main bus stand and also far from any passing taxis. I don't trust the local yellow cabs as they can rip you off and the Ola or Uber services in this area can be unreliable. 

Better to get a taxi first to Dakshineswar and then go to Belur Math by ferry as there is a better chance of getting transport back to the city. More",Apr-17

There are morning prayers which create a captivating atmosphere where you can see local citizens participating along with the singing and playing musical instruments. The outside complex has several shops selling prayer related items. There are few shops which provide breakfast, generally luchi (puri) and sweets which are a part of quintessential Bengali breakfast. If you too health conscious, then you may avoid eating here as it is all fried/high calorie stuff (though it is difficult to escape once you are in Bengal ). Tip: After visiting the temple, you can catch a ferry/boat to Belur and visit Belur Math. The ferry ride in itself is worth it and at a very nominal amount.

Please carry your items like sweets or flowers etc. From outside the temple premises. People are charging too high within the temple premises and stuff is not even that good.

Do visit all 12 shiv temples within the premises. 

Normal evening aarti timings are around 6:30 PM good but the room from where the aarti is visible is having some optical interference so you can enjoy the aarti only standing or sitting in the centre lane.

The Dakshineswar Kali Temple was founded around the middle of the 19th Century by Rani Rashmoni. Rani Rashmoni was well known for her philanthropic activities. In the year 1847, Rashmoni, prepared to go upon a long pilgrimage to the sacred Hindu city of Kashi to express her devotions . Rani was to travel in twenty four boats, carrying relatives, servants and supplies. According to traditional accounts, the night before the pilgrimage began, Rashmoni had a vision of the Divine Mother, in the form of the goddess Kali in a dream and reportedly said 
“ There is no need to go to Banaras. Install my statue in a beautiful temple on the banks of the Ganges river and arrange for my worship there. Then I shall manifest myself in the image and accept worship at that place.” 
Profoundly affected by the dream, Rani immediately looked for and purchased a 20-acred plot in the village of Dakshineswar. The large temple complex was built between 1847 and 1855. The 20-acre plot was bought from an Englishman, John Hastie and was then popularly known as ""Saheban Bagicha"", partly old Muslim burial ground shaped like a tortoise, considered befitting for the worship of Shakti according to Tantric traditions, it took eight years and around nine hundred thousand rupees to complete the construction, and finally the idol of Goddess Kali was installed on the Snana Yatra day on 31 May 1855. On 31 May 1855 more than 1 lakh Brahmins were invited from different parts of the country to grace the auspicious occasion of inauguration of this temple. 
Formally known as Sri Sri Jagadishwari Mahakali, with Ramkumar Chhattopadhyay as the head priest; soon his younger brother Gadai or Gadadhar (later known as Ramakrishna Paramhansa) moved in and spent a considerable part of his life here.

According to legend Rani Rasmoni had a dream where the goddess Kali instructed her to build a temple. She bought a land on the banks of Hooghly and started the construction. The temple was finally completed in 1855. She offered the place of the head priest to Ram Kumar Chhattopadhyay, who was the elder brother of Ramakrishna. After the death of Ram Kumar, Ramakrishna overtook the duty as the head priest. Ramakrishna was perhaps the most famous saint and devotee of the goddess Kali. He was also the mentor of Swami Vivekananda. 
The temple is built in traditional Bengali style. The Garba-griha contains the idol of goddess Kali standing on the chest of lying Lord Shiva. The idols are placed on thousand petal lotus made of silver.

Top tips - 
1. To save money and time, you can take metro until Shyambazar and then take auto to the temple. 
2. Travel light as you will be charged to keep all of your belongings at a deposit centre. Yes all of them...you won't be allowed even a handbag. Keep your money with you, may be in your pocket. 
3. Visit before 9 am, you will have a very short queue for everything. 
4. There are 3 different queues to the main mandir (temple) - 2 to see Maa Kali (the shrine) from the side and one to see her from front. Ask properly and then queue up. 
5. Use the steamer from Dakhineshwar (a short walk from the temple) to go to Belur Math. Will be a good idea to take the steamer back to Dakhineshwar as its easier to travel back to Kolkata. Travelling back to Kolkata from Belur Math is otherwise treaky and expensive. More",Dec-16

The only difficulty I faced is lighting up the Fragrance stick(dhub batti) as you are not supposed to carry matchstick. You really have to be patient enough lighting the stick from the other burning sticks. You may also step into river hoogly flowing at the back of the temple. If you have time you may take a divine bath. You may linger around in the big courtyard of the temple and sense it's Devine spirituality. I have often heard that prasad (bhog) is offered by paying a nominal amount but I am not pretty sure about it. I believe that this review would be helpful for travelers visiting this Devine temple. Mark it helpful if you like my post.

Camera is prohibited,but the art of the temple is so beautiful ..you won't mind to take a chance and go for couple of shot . Visit adjoining garden to take a view of the bally bridge and in the garden you would get to see monkeys :)they r friendly though. For travellers I would suggest to ""Belurr math"" from here another top destinations but go via Ganga not by road. cross the Ganga via boat.feery ghats is near to that garden.Another... Honestly I cannot rate this place.being this place this oìvv7 30 mins away from where I stay I have come over numerous time since my b for last to years visiting this place with my baby girl. 
Over the last 20-25yrs since when I am visiting this place, this has become better and better in terms of overall temple environment. Pretty clean compare to many other pilgrims /temple. Best part is that you don't need to take the pain of the so called PANDAs. Doesn't matter where you r standing in the queue..queue is very fast moving and it takes max 30 mins to an hour to complete the ""darshan "".I guess it remain close from 12 to 2 pm, so.avoid that time slot.

Still needs a lot of improvement,ParamitaC,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,25-Jun-16,"Reaching the place of late has become quite tiresome with roads being diverted due to the construction of a skywalk. Till this gets ready, be prepared to walk a mile or take a rickshaw to save the walk. The rickshaw though drops passengers off only till the Singhadwar from which its another 500 meters to the mandir. There are multiple shops, all numbered for buying offerings as well as deposit your shoes and any other stuff that you need to. Mobile phones to be deposited only at designated place against which a token is given. Once inside the temple which is a well kept magnanimous campus with the mandir on one side and the twelve Shivlingas on the other. Ensure to enter the main mandir from the queue that is closer to the last building (which was the resting place of Ramakrishna deb) so as to be able to see Maa from the front. The other two queues would lead you to the side darshan of Maa. One can also take a dip in the ganga before proceeding for the darshan, though not widely done. While the darshan experience is divine and one cares less about the upkeep of the mandir, but being a devout devotee of Kali Maa, I still wish the management could have taken more care towards the maintenance and revisit the manner in which the darshan is conducted.

The best temple complex of India.,PSM947,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,18-May-16,"I have been to many temples all over India but this particular temple is undoubtedly the best in my opinion due to the following reasons: 

1. Location - located at the bank of Ganges, the surroundings are very calm and peaceful. Even if someone is not very devotional, they can just make a visit for enjoying nature at it's very best. Also, it's very well connected to the main city through different modes of public transportation. One can also take the ferry and cross the river to visit the belur math very easily. 

2. No pandas - this is probably the most important aspect due to which people can uninterruptedly visit the temple and offer their prayers. Very few temples in India have this option. No one to fool you with false shortcuts to god's house and disturb your own peace of mind. Because some people like me mostly visit temples to find peace!! 

3. Cleanliness and maintenance - one can undoubtedly say that this is also the cleanest of all temples. It's very well maintained and one can keep their personal belongings at designated tokenised lockers and go for prayers without any worries. More",Apr-16

I didn't buy prasad to offer to the God and that took care of not having to stand in the lines in the hot afternoon. I managed to to do the darshan. You go around visiting all the little temples in the premises, 12 of which are devoted to Lord Shiv. On asking one of the Pandits, I was told that Goddess Kali was told in a dream to erect 12 temples of Lord Shiv (12 from his 109 Avatars) and that's how the temple came to be. 

It's a good place to have a view of the Ganges as well. There are little souvenir shops around the premises and snacks that you may eat.

The temple is easily accessible by road and rail from Kolkata (takes 30mins) and is on the banks of the Hoogly river. There are no priest lobbies pushing and cursing you (unlike Kalighat or Puri temples). However, the puja thali vendors outside the temple premises could be annoying. Just ignore them and buy offering per your wish (starting Rs.5).The main temple has 1 Kali, 1 Radha Krishna and 7 Shiva temples. This place can be crowded at times, also please check the temple timings before you visit (it is closed in the afternoon). 
I would conclude by saying that the Dakshineswar temple is a place as much of religious significance as that of national integrity. A person of any religion can visit and would be enthralled by the divinity.

Abot Teple & History,Meet19,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,2-Nov-15,"A dream inspired the construction of the Dakshineshwar Temple in Kolkata, a structure more than 100 ft high, built within a huge complex that also houses 12 shrines dedicated to Shiva and one to Radha-Krishna. In 1847, when the wealthy widow Rani Rashmoni was preparing to leave for Varanasi, Goddess Kali appeared in her dream and said, “There is no need to go to Kashi. Install my statue in a beautiful temple on the banks of the Ganga and arrange for my worship there.” The Rani did so. 

To the west of the vast temple courtyard stand 12 Shiva temples of Bengali aatchala (eight-roofs) style in a row. Sri Ramakrishna spent many years in the chamber to the north-west, a little beyond the last of the Shiva temples.

You can see the huge Bally Bridge and now also the Nivedita setu ,spanning the Hooghly and sounds of various trains going over the bridge, makes a typical booming noise. 

The Goddess Kali is ever smiling and resplendent in all her glory. Going inside the sanctum sanctorum is forbidden for commoners but can be made possible if you are some VIP.

A row of twelve identical Shiva temples built close to the main temple facing the east in the typical ‘Aat Chala’ Bengal architecture, they are built on either side of the ghat on the Hoogly River. 
Kali, meaning Bhavataraini, 'She who liberates her devotees from the ocean of existence. Bhava means universe /nature/whatever we can see or feel. There are three main powers one is Ishwar (God), second is Jiv (Creature) and third is prakriti (Nature). As per Veda these three always exist. Alwayes changing Prakriti /nature or bhava is made of atoms we all made of nature. Creature/Jeev is a combination of Soul+Nature, God is not involved in the nature so the God is invisible. 
The idol of goddess Kali standing on the chest of lying Shiva, and the two idols are placed on a thousand-petaled lotus made of silver. Ramakrishna param hansa, along with his wife Sarada Devi, spent 30 years as head priest till his death in 1886.

Some tips for upcoming visitors: 

Try to visit in the early morning hours as the outside temple stone flooring gets very heated in summers due to high temperature, can be a cause of concern for old age people and kids. 

If visiting after 9AM It's better to carry an umbrella and a water bottle as one is not sure how long will it take for the queue to get over.

Nat Mandir -- 50ft in length and 75 ft in width, this 16 pillared structure with a roof is an open hall which served the purpose for many religious discourses as well as spiritual songs. Just above the Nat Mandir, there is an idol of Lord Shiva whom Sri Ramkrishna always prayed before entering the Kali temple. To the south of this Nat Mandir there is a place for religious sacrifice. It was here in a religious gathering Bhairavi Bramhani Yogeshwari Devi according to the Sashtra proved Sri Ramakrishna to be an 
avatar. In the Nat Mandir in 1864 the ‘Annomeru Utsav’ was held by Mathur Mohan Biswas. Various religious songs like ‘chandigaan’, ‘jatragaan’, ‘Kali Katha’, ‘bhajan kirtan’, ‘matri sangeet’ and more are held here. 

In the temple premises, in the North West corner is the room of Sri Ramkrishna where he stayed for the last 14 years of his life. Sri Ramkrishna initially stayed at Kuthi Bari but at the demise of his nephew in Kuthi Bari he no longer wanted to reside there. It was on an occasion of renovation of the Kuthi Bari, he was allotted the room within the temple premises. On completion of the renovation he no longer wanted to return to his original room and thus arrangements were made for him to permanently reside in the room which we call today the ‘Room of Sri Ramkrishna’. 

In 1872 it was here Sri Ramkrishna conducted the ‘Phalharini Kali Puja’ when he offered puja to Sri Sarada Ma praying her as the mother Goddess. Various articles used by Sri Ramkrishna are now exhibited. The pitcher that held Ganga water in his room is still found in its place. 
Sri Ramkrishna had an ardent group of followers like Swami Vivekananda and Keshab Chandra Sen with whom he had spiritual discussions here. During the ‘Kalpataru Utsav’ special puja is performed.

During our stay at Belur Math from 21 December to 25 December 2014, I again visited Dakshineswar after some years. I still remember my first visit in November 1994 when I felt great joy there.

The atmosphere is still intense with spiritual vibrations and the mind gets concentrated. I felt good there. Then we went to Holy Mother's room at the Nahabat of Dakshineswar. It is such a small place and Holy Mother Sarada stayed there, cooked there and lived there doing one lakh times japa daily of her mantra for so many years. Her forbearance and patience is almost unbelievable. Last I visited the Nahabat, I had felt an inner peace for some moments. This time I had felt bliss I think. We visited the holy panchavati where Shri Ramakrishna performed so much austerities for decades. It has been reduced to a picnic spot and a tourist attraction. Still, the very thought that Shri Ramakrishna lived and walked about there was exhilarating. More",Dec-14

But, this could be realised only recently, but somewhat unsatisfactorily due to paucity of time. At this time of the year, which is considered auspicious by Bengalis, the crowd is unusually large. Inspite of the crowd, the temple campus is well maintained. The queue for seeing the deity ""Bhavtarini"" (""rescuer of the world""), was quite long with over thousand waiting even at 1 pm in the afternoon. 

But, what I wish to write about is not the temple, but about the bathing ghat attached to the temple campus. People use the river with utter disregard to other users. Besides bathing, I saw some people gargling and spitting into the holy river. Ganga is not a sink, or wash basin or a drain. Evidently people who go to the bathing ghat take pains to go there because they believe in the holiness attached to Ganga. But, why do the people pollute and defile the river? After seeing this, one despires, whether Ganga will ever be cleaned up within our life time? though Tripadvisor medium, I urge the visitors not to defile the river and contribute their mite to purify the Ganga.

first priest was sri ramkumar chatterje and with in a year the responsibility was given to the great Sri Sri Ramakrishna who during the subsequent thirty years became the seeker of the Goddess Kali and an ardent devotee who fixed deeply the seed of change in the socio-religious condition of Bengal and earned huge reputation for the Dakshineswar temple.

To quote few happening I may tell you that the Gods were defeated in the wars against Shumbha and Nishumbha, the two Asura brothers and driven out of their abode of heaven. The Gods prayed her for help. She took the form Kali or Kalika (means dark) and killed those Asuras. She also killed Chandasur. In order to end the menace of Raktabij, Kali spread out her tongue and drank all the blood of Raktabij. That is the reason for her protruding tongue. Kali is said to be the first Vidya of ten Mahavidyas. She is the consort of Lord Mahakal as such she is called Mahakali. She has or assumes several forms. Though she looks most terrible, yet she is calm and benefactress of her devotees. 

Once when she appeared in the form of Mahakali before Adishankara, he was not perturbed. When she questioned him whether he was scared to see her as Kali, he calmly and most humbly replied” Oh! Mother how can a child be scared of his mother in whatever form she appears. You are my mother. There is no room for the fear in my mind. I know, for that matter every child is sure that its mother will never harm the child. There may be bad son but there can never be a bad mother. So when you are my Mother why this queries MOM” 

Rani Rashmoni of Jan Bazar, Kolkata was an exception amidst the male dominated society. She stood as a pillar of strength in the matter of maintaining the Kali temple in Dakshineswar, Kolkata during mid-nineteenth century. She was born on 28.9. 1793 and married to Babu Rajchandra Das of Jan Bazar at the age of 11 years. Her husband died leaving her all alone to maintain his large zamindari and commerce. She quickly learnt the skill of management and inbuilt supervisory cleverness. 

She was an autonomist and stood by what she meant reasonable and just. Her daring performance and confrontations with the then British in India were historical to her family stories in her time. Her greatest contribution was the construction of Kali temple at Dakshineshwar. It was she who patronized the young lad Gadadhar 
( later known as Shri Ramakrishna) as the priest in Kali temple. He was so deeply immersed in his worship of the goddess and he was able to read the mind of the devotees and advise them suitably at his young age. Once it so happened that Rani Rashmoni was performing puja standing in front of the idol, silently, closing both eyes with folded hands. Suddenly Gadadhar slapped her on her cheek. She was shocked at the attitude of the boy whom she herself inducted there. She curiously looked at him. Then he warned her saying “when you are standing in front of the Mother Goddess you must not think of your court case. She will take care of all your cases if you keep her in your soul and mind”. 

She was not angry at the boy, but apologised saying 
“Sorry Swamiji. It is true I was greatly worried about the case before court today. Henceforth I will not do so.” 
“You need not worry she has already taken care of it. Go home peacefully.” So consoled Gadadhara. It was turned out later that she had won that case on the spur of the moment when he said so. 

Her spiritual attitude and love for the Hinduism and Hindu culture was the cause for encouraging Gadadhara. She was an outstanding social worker. Her philanthropic nature and anxiety to improve the standard of the poor were notable aspects for which people called her as ‘Rani’ or the queen, though she was not the queen of any country empire. She died on 19.2.1861. The enormous achievements she made in her life as a Hindu woman would be a spirit and motivation to many future women generation in the country. As a mark of remembrance the Postal Department brought out a postage stamp on the occasion of her bicentennial celebrations. 

Mother goddess Kali temple is situated at Dakshineswar in Kolkata. Therefore it is popularly known as Dakshineswar Kali temple. It is located on the eastern bank of the Hooghly River in the name of Bhavatarini, which is a feature of Kali. It means that one who liberates her devotees from the ocean family (samsara). The temple was built by Rani Rashmoni who was a devotee of Kali during 1855. The temple became famous and most popular because of its association with Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, a mystic of 19th Century. 

The temple has a large courtyard surrounded by rooms along the boundary walls. Within the compound you can see twelve shrines of Lord Shiva, the companion of goddess Kali. Radha-Krishna temple is seen along the river front and a bathing ghat. There is also a shrine of Rani Rashmoni. Gadadhara (Ramakrishna) came to the temple in 1855 to assist his elder brother, Ramkumar. Later he became the head priest after the death of his brother. Sri Ramakrishna used to say that for devotees it was not necessary to go to Banaras since Dakshineswar is more than Banaras. 

Sri Ramakrishna spent a substantial part of his life at the chamber in the north-western corner called 'Nahavat-Khana'. It is just by the side of the last of the Shiva temples. More",May-14

Yes, the place is very crowded, for obvious reasons. But the crowd is very well managed. The line moves pretty swiftly and I would rate it as an extremely professional way of handling devotees. You don't really need to pay anything extra for faster darshan. Just be in the line and you would reach your destination within reasonable time. 

The puja items for dedicating to Maa can be found outside the temple premises.

Blissfull Experience. Beware of Cons!,Aryan M,"Nairobi, Kenya",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,16-Sep-14,"The overall experience was amazing. For Hindus, getting Kali Maa's darshan in her original form is simply blissful. They do not allow camera's and it is recommended that when you go there travel as light as possible. Do not go with wallets and unnecessary back packs. 
Please be very careful of the Pandits. They will come and tell you that it will cost you Rs. 52/= for a complete Darshan and Offerings (some flowers and prasadam to Kaali Maa). But the moment you walk in, you will end up spending over 1,500/= Rs. Be very careful with your money. Many pickpockets. Very many beggars. The Pandit will try and make you spend more money for various 'ceremonial performances'. Skip it all. You do not need to throw money to please god. All they want is your pure devotion. 
When you are done from the temple, you will come out to the shoe stand - do not pay more than Rs 20 for your shoes.

Ramkrishna Paramhansa lived in a small room on the west side of the famed Kali Temple built by the queen, Rani Rashmoni between 1847 and 1855 on the banks of the river Hoghly. Though employed as a priest for the Kali Temple by the queen, Sri. Ramkrishna was constantly in search for much more than the daily rituals of offering puja. He developed a bond with Ma Kali and soon people would see him speaking with the idol of Kali as if it were the real mother of Sri. Ramkrishna. Such was the level of spiritual elevation that soon people from all over Calcutta would flock to see him or touch his feet. Swami Vivekananda however came to visit him out of curiosity and test his real character as a mortal. 

Having being convinced that Sri. Ramkrishna Paramhansa was truly a person with divine spiritual blessings, Swamiji became his most important disciple and subsequently formed the Ramkrishna Mission world wide to spread the teachings of his Guru. 

Visitors must see the idol of Ma Kali and the room Sri Ramkrishna lived for many years.

(getting inside the river isnt recommended - the current is usually strong). on the flipside, it may be difficult for you to get to this place if you dont have your own vehicle..its atleast 45 mins drive from chowringhee (central kolkata). so plan accordingly.

Avoid on auspicious days as it can get very very very crowded. Do you really believe God answers prayers only on special days? 

Recommended: 
Arrive and finish your puja as early as possible. Temple opens at 6:00/6:30AM. Have a breakfast of 'hing kochuri' - its a specialty of this place. Then take a country boat to cross the river to Belur Math. (Belur is closed between 12:00 to 4:00 so time accordingly).

We walked the large temple premises bare feet, they are very clean. The eateries closest to the temple seemed quite unclean. We had wanted to eat there but promptly turned our backs because of the stink emanating from the first one that we entered.

The best thing about this place is there is no burden on the visitor to offer ""Puja"", so even one is only inclined to visit the shrine, s/he can do that without anyone bothering.

The evening prayer to Goddess Kali can clean the mind of stress. In some ill-informed literature, Goddess Kali is wrongly associated with Evil practices. Actually, in Hindu religion, Kali is worshiped to get rid of the evil in us - in our thought & acts.

One can feel the love and peace from Mother here. Later, we went around the 12 replicas of the Jothirlingas, just opposite the Mother's shrine. Another unforgetable place here is Sri Ramakrishna's room...the very place he had meditated, met his students and gave discourses. The vibration here is electric, and spending some time sitting around the small room in meditation is truly benefical. After that, we took a boat ride across the Ganges to Belur Math.

The queue was short, the darshan uninterrupted by priests, and one came back to view the deity from up close, then from a little distance and then from the steps leading to the shrine, entranced by the peace and the sanctity of the place. It is here that Ramakrishna had his many visions, he dressed Her up and worshipped Her as per his whims and it is here that the faithful realised that Kali Maa could heal and unburden their prayers! 
One could sense that eclectic sense of a fair scheme of the Universe under the Divine Mother, as protector, and destroyer, the beloved of Her children, that was to later create the monastic order of the Ramakrishna Mission for emancipation of Hindu Society. Kali as a deity in the Hindu Pantheon had been associated heavily with Tantra, Kaulava Yogini traditions, with sorcery and witchcraft in folk and mainstream Hinduism. For Ramakrishna She transformed into an Adoring Deity of Blessings! 
Even for those who are neutral to religiosity, Dakshineshwar offers a sense of beauty, symmetry and this small complex of beautiful shrines converging over a larger multi domed shrine to Kali, on the banks of the wide Ganges flowing past, makes an elegant statement. 
There are several eateries along the approach road which offer to attend to your hunger pangs, all offering local version of aloo-dham, and pooris( called Kachoris) which have some masala added to the dough.The fare is cheap and fulfilling. 
One can take the boat across to Belur Math, which is 20 taka (rupee's local name) per pax. One can hire an entire boat for 200 like we did. One can get a ride from Metro till Sham bazaar, take the bus route 32 to Dakshineshwar, then fetch the ferry to Belur and take another bus to Hoogly or Kolkata from there if one wishes to avoid the need for a hired taxi.

Divine and disciplined,Arnab M,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,29-Jul-13,"Dakshineshwar Temple is a popular spot on the bank of River Hooghly. You can approach it by getting down at Dakshineshwar station (Sealdah - Dankuni line) or by road from Dunlop (on BT Road). The best time to visit Dakshineshwar is during winters. You can take a ferry from Dakshineshwar to Belur (to visit Ramkrishna Mission temple) and enjoy the river ride, but summers and monsoon would not be the best period to enjoy this ride. You have to enter the temple premises without shoes. A lot of shops selling garlands and agarbattis would offer to guard your shoes, but it is best to keep your shoes at the shoe-store right opposite the entrance of the temple. The temple premises would be crowded with devotees on auspicious or special days, but it has lot more discipline in comparison to other famous temples in the city. 

You won't get much time to see the deity and might be asked to move ahead very quickly. So, be prepared accordingly. If you ask me, its best to go the temple early morning, offer a puja, have breakfast in the nearby sweet shops, and then head straight to Belur. The view of the temple from the river is bound to bring a sense of tranquility in you.

"All a bit mental, but this is India and I loved it!",newtownbear,"Chester, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,24-Feb-13,"This was one of the stranger places I visited at the tail end of my Indian adventure. It freaked me out a little, as the lovely silver ring I had bought earlier in my trip decided it would fly off of my finger whilst I was throwing the ceremonial flowers onto the Kali statue where it could not be retrieved. Gutted. Still, I put it down to experience and can laugh about it now when I look back. The temple itself is quite interesting, I liked the fact it was a bit darker/weirder than the usual affair, no need to get yourself a guide really, but do prepare yourself for hordes of people so keep an eye on your things would be my advice. A little out the way but well worth a visit. More",Mar-12
Kali Temple,Karen_Ogilvie,"London, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,20-Feb-13,Much smaller than expected and extremely crowded but we did go on an auspicious (no moon?) day. Without the help of a guide who fast tracked us through we probably wouldn't even have got in. I had no feeling of being in a building as such. It was all a bit weird. There was an area where the pundits were reciting the holy books - one was on his mobile - and a place where they slaughtered goats. A few shrines. Interesting but not what I expected.,Feb-13

Great mother standing and keeping her one leg on Shiva lying down... Oh God, no word can be uttered to explain the feeling you get on seeing her. All the bad in you shall be whipped away by the One Look of Kalimatha .

I had been there by about 7 pm and was there for more than an hour. The bhajans sung are by the devotees spontaneously and being one amount them , I felt like having a cool swim in Ganga and felt relieved, refreshed and totally cut off from the personal thoughts. Great !! 
03. The room where the cot of Paramahamsa is being kept. 
One word - CRY.. For peace .so quiet, all people coming in does meditate there. Medication is quite easy there, hope because of the saint. 
04. The room in which Paramahamsa lived , facing Ganga. . You enter that room, see the life size statue of Paramahamsa ., you are filled with joy, sorrow, happiness, despair, what not.

At other times there are usually very long queues but still does not take much time to reach the deity.

If you want to visit both this place and Belur math then take metro to Shyam bazaar ( I took from parkstreet) and then hire a taxi to Dakhineswar for 80-120 rupees (depending on the time and traffic). After visiting temple you can take a ferry to Belur math and spent time there ( i reccomend spending atleast 4 hrs in that amazing silence) and then take a ferry (Rs.10/person) back to Dakshineswar and do the above in reverse.

I was hit on by various beggers all the way to the gate. Once there, you have to take off your shoes and leave them in a heap. If you have modern tennis shoes, expect them to stand out like a sore thumb, and they might very well be ripped off. (not be be calous, but it's the truth..temptation..wear flip flops) No cameras allowed nor mobiles. 

I went on one of the weekly holy days so it was hot and crowded. I went around say 11am, and the line was maybe 45min to get inside the shrine. That's a lot of heat and time for anyone over 30. You may drop, and this is no place to drop. 

Tips: You can buy an offering (flowers and incense) outside, BUT!!!! Dont smell the incense. Don't stick your nose down to the sticks to see how it smells, lit or unlit. I did that, and it blows the Mojo or whatever, and the seller gets annoyed, throws that incense away and has to get you a fresh one.

The area is burstling, the street is more crowded than a rock festival. Taking a guide through the poorer Indian people in the area, you arrive at the ancient Kali temple on foot. You'll be told to watch your wallet and be careful and respectful. From then onwards you take a tour of about half an hour, seeing the sights of the temple, people actively worshipping and praying with lots of spirit and shouting, the place is near total chaos. Your guide guides you through the masses, explains that the temple feeds thousands along the way, and takes you to a place less crowded in the temple where you can pray and donate and get Kali's blessing.

If you are at all squeamish then I would suggest you avoid the animal sacrifices. I am not sure how many animals my guide said had been sacrificed that day- I was a bit shocked- but the sacrifice pit had been well used and while I was there the boy goats were being sacrificed as fast as they could be positioned. I guess it is some improvement over the supposed history of human sacrifice to this goddess. 
I was assured that the sacrifice was for the poor. 
At the conclusion of your tour you could be presented with a donation book containing the names of foreigners and the donations they had received that day. 
On a quick scan of those that had donated I quickly realised I was not carrying enough money!! I am not sure about the entire veracity of their accounting system and in the end I was not as generous as other supposed contributors. 
All in all quite an experience and I am sure I don't really need to see it all again. More",Nov-10

The Goddess looked so vivid , it seemed to be a human being so stunningly beautiful , no doubt the saint would go into raptures when he used to perform pujas , he in fact started off as a pujari initially. To enjoy and appreciate all this one should read his autobiography (2)volumes and then spend time in Dakshineshwar , if possible by empathising with the situation , surroundings and people of those times.We spent a full day. The next day we visited Belur Math , headquarters of Ramakrishna Math. We went by boat ,took us more than 45 minutes to cross the Ganges. That day was windy and cold . Once there the sight was awesome , stretched out over several acres. Incidentally the place is approachable by road also. A must- see- and- hear is the evening aarti which infuses so much of spiritual energy in a person. To get a good view one should assemble early in the spacious hall which gets filled up very fast. 

In Dakshineshwar there are a lot of shops selling many spiritual items and other curios. It is advisable to shop here rather than at Belur Math where things are costly. 

Last day we visited Tarakeshwar which takes 2hours by taxi.Better to go early morning . 
This is an old temple of Lord Shiva worshipped by people to get their wishes fulfilled. A word of caution , beware of touts waiting to strip one's wallets and clothes. In any case one has to remove his shoes and belts. Just put your head down and pay obeisance do not follow any one's directions. 

Three days are sufficient for Dakshineshwar trip , it is advisable to obtain information before visiting so as to have better appreciation. More",Feb-11

Try to find the whiter tilestones as they are not so hot as the dark ones. 

You pass the crowed of holi pilgrims again, find eventually your shoes, hand the guide some money for the tour on the fast track as without him I would have lost conscious after five minutes queuing in the overly packed line of hindu pilgrims. 

For preparation read writeup about god Kali, that is helpful in the sea of godesses in India, I guess about 2 millions they have I was told. 

When you leave the place you need some time to recover, I got so wrapped in the atmoshere and ongoing things there, I could not associate the writeup in my travel guide to what I experienced there. 

A MUST IF YOU ARE IN KOLKATA; THAT IS THE REAL THING! When I left with my dot on the forehead I felt a bit overprivileged as I got to bypass all the patient pilgrims but I was grateful for the help and guidance and explanation there. Consider your donation beforehand and have the money ready, I was taken by surprise, spent 20 USD only and felt bad afterwards, not giving more to that selfless institution. 

Unfortunately I missed Mother Theresa hospice that is only around the corner, that I got to know when I was already miles away. Try to combine to see her bequest.

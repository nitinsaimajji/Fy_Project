nikko park kolkata,jouherkhan,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,10-Feb-19,"Nicco park is located in the Salt Lake area spreading across the 40 acres land. A full package of entertainment is Nicco. It is best for kids and young ones, teenagers as well as adults. For a day out with family, one must not forget the name of Nicco park. It remains open from 10 am to 5 pm. The travel route is not very difficult. Friends can go in bike or a family can hire private taxi or cab. Beside Nicco is lot of food stalls too. How can one forget the rides! The best part of this amusement park is Wet-o-wild where we simply have fun in waters. Its amazing to visit there in summer. A lot of free rides are also there. Striking car, river cave, boating, flying saucer and roller coaster are simply brilliant. Another region of Nicco is dry which is also very nice. Lots of passes and offers are also available. Those who are heart patients must just avoid a few heartthrumping rides otherwise the visit is worthy enough with the charge it takes. More",Oct-18

Full on fun for family,MdZaff,"Asansol, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-Jan-19,"The park is for everyone. One can spend the whole day in the park.Usually it is very crowded in weekend and you need to have patience to cover all the rides. It is recommended that you book the entry ticket online to save some bucks. Also,book the entry ticket only as it comes with 12 free rides including MIG plane and Eiffel Tower. You can take unlimited rides. Once inside you may choose the paid rides as per your convinience as it is time consuming due to the long queues which will tire you.

Okay okay for children,saronichatterjee27,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,19-Dec-18,"Every time we go to Nicco Park hoping for some full fledged fun and every time return with broken heart. The same ride, the same set up, the same inconvenience... Just last time we noticed some new touches of colours in some places. 1. The entry fee to the park is Rs.200, which includes 12 free rides. But believe me none of the free ride is enjoyable for kids also. Their are some marry-go-round type items which can be easily available in any village fair in Rs 10-20-30... 2. You can't carry your own food... that's fine , but the food stalls and food court are too much overpriced. Please carry your drinking water, they allow it. Otherwise you have to buy 1 lt. bottle for Rs 50. 3. There is no clear road map, from where you can easily identify the ticket counters for various rides. Management can easily arrange ticket selling kiosk beside every ride to avoide such inconvenience. 4. There are lack of cleanliness. The benches all around the park are dirty and somewhere broken. Toilets are smelly and dirty too. 5. From our last experience I feel that the children park needs some more sitting arrangements for parents or guardians.

Terrible Experience - Worst management and rude staff!!!,498pritis,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,23-Nov-18,"We visited Nicco Park hoping to have a fun filled day, however to our dismay the amusement park is very poorly managed. First of all you you don't get clear instructions regarding tickets anywhere. The free rides were such that even children would not like them. Moreover there was only one place in the park to buy tickets for other rides and that too with just one window open. 
The rides are very poorly managed. One of the ride started while we were not even properly seated with absolutely no regard for safety. 
The ride managers were extremely rude and had no consideration that you are rude. Overall a very bad experience and whoever has gone to any other amusement parks would be highly disappointed. More",Nov-18

Rusty Park,tumbleweedchris,"New Orleans, Louisiana",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,19-Oct-18,"I visited Nicco Park as a general fan of amusement parks around the world, but would suggest regular tourists skip it. There are some redeemable qualities about the park. The wooden coaster is a particularly fun ride and a rarity for India. The mirror maze is a surprisingly excellent mirror maze. And the water chute is a iffy, but fun, attraction provided you can get enough riders to fill a car. There are a few ok flat rides, but not much else stands out. Most of the rides appear to be in questionable repair overall. Unfortunately the dark ride and haunted house were closed when I visited. It does appear that a percentage of rides are probably closed at any given operating day. The last fun bit to note is the robot tiger welcoming you to the park at the entrance. More",Oct-18

Great but the package deal is a bit of a rip off,Stefan v,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,18-Aug-18,"We visited the park with a two year old. The park itself is great although some of the attractions are a bit short. 
The biggest problem are the attractions that are not included in the 600 INR ""package deal"" for which you have to pay extra. Nobody tells you before that so you're overpaying by a large margin compared to the 185 INR 12 attractions deal.

Oldest Amusement Park In India,epicureantales,"Hyderabad, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,28-Feb-18,"This is the oldest amusement park in India. I remember going there as a small kid and it used to be called ""Jheel Meel"" back then and it did not have much attractions but it had a collection of animals, small sandy hill and park. It has been renovated since then many times and also got it's name changed to ""Nicco Park"". I visited it along with a friend in November 2017 and we bought a online entry ticket to the main park at Rs.185 per person. Some rides like the Toy train and paddle boat were free and we were charged for others. My favorite rides used to be ""Twist 'N' Turn"", ""Water Chute"" and ""Cave Ride"" so I did all the three and even though there is no adrenaline rush as these are very basic rides, it felt good and made me happy. Next we explored the park and now there are two areas inside the park ; Wet area and Dry Area. We did not visit the wet area and basically the Nicco Park can be divided into four areas 1) Main Park 2) Wet 'n' Wild: water park 3) Nicco super bowl; Bowling alley and 4) Bowlers Den which is a restaurant located on top of the Bowling alley. One important tip is to never visit it on either Weekends or Holidays, it becomes crazily filled with people and also never visit it after 6 Pm... This is the oldest amusement park in India.

"Very poor maintenance, rude staff",manas p,"Bangalore, Karnataka, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,16-Dec-17,"Before starting the review, I would like to mention, Nicco Park is the place which I visited at my middle school age, high school age, college age and now. The maintenance degradation is clearly visible to me. (1) Toy train which is a major attraction for all age people, was very dirty. Instead of the yellow toy train, you guys can run the blue train which is standing in the toy-train shed. (2) The crazy tea party, the entrance and exit place is same. People were forced to leave via entry gate because the exit gate was locked. (3) Surprisingly, the entry gate of most of the rides were opened when the rides are ON. Anytime kids can go inside. It is really alarming. (4) The game center staff behavior is utterly rude. I purchased 10 games ticket. Ideally, they should give me 10 coins which I can use in any of the available games. Instead of that, one person started roaming behind my kid with 10 coins. I felt like we are in some shopping center and a sales guy chasing us. (5) A person was distributing leaflets about some aquarium having piranha, giant crab etc. Seeing the outlook of the aquarium room, I did not feel to spend 50 rupees for that. Sorry to say, from outside, the room was looking like an abandoned hut. On a positive note, food quality is really good. I did not visit...

People were forced to leave via entry gate because the exit gate was locked. (3) Surprisingly, the entry gate of most of the rides were opened when the rides are ON. Anytime kids can go inside. It is really alarming. (4) The game center staff behavior is utterly rude. I purchased 10 games ticket. Ideally, they should give me 10 coins which I can use in any of the available games. Instead of that, one person started roaming behind my kid with 10 coins. I felt like we are in some shopping center and a sales guy chasing us. (5) A person was distributing leaflets about some aquarium having piranha, giant crab etc. Seeing the outlook of the aquarium room, I did not feel to spend 50 rupees for that. Sorry to say, from outside, the room was looking like an abandoned hut. 
On a positive note, food quality is really good. I did not visit the water park part. So no comments on that front. But I felt really sad that I could not show the beauty of Nicco Park to my kids which we enjoyed at childhood. Please consider this as my own view, no intention of hurting anyone. More",Dec-17

I also saw Eiffel tower replica there. not sure when climbing up was allowed or not. The park has also constructed a water park, Wet-O-Wild, inside the amusement park(I guess better water park than Aquatica). There is also a rain dance performance. The park also has a 4-D movie theater.

Food in water park is good but bit expensive. we passed almost 5 hrs in waterpark without getting boared. Water is clean and not irritating to your eyes. 

Only drawback is you have water point but no water except near rope way for drinking. 

One more gimmic going on the nicco park website, I bought coupon from near by group on which give 40% discount in composite package. So do book thorough that and enjoy 40% discount. Actually website said you have to buy entry ticket(200RS) and composite ticket (450) so the total price 650 per person, but it is not like that. Once you choose composite package you don't need yup buy entry ticket which save 200rs per person but I reccomand please check before book. because I have already wasted that money.

Unlimited fun and rides,tanumoyghosh,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,16-Jan-16,"Nicco Park is all time entertainment place for all ages. 
They usually provide discount offers during winter around the Christmas embargo. However, you can also find discount coupons from internet as well. 
Now the place is broadly segmented into two parts - 1. Land Package and 2. Water Package 
I have opted for both the packages which costs me around Rs. 500. 
In water package, you will find different rides which will really give you fun. Even it has a pool where artificial waves are created along with music. They have separate washrooms for male and female with locker facility. Even if you are not carrying extra clothes you may buy new one or take rent with keeping some amount as deposit. 
In the land package the most attractive one is cyclone which will really give you an adrenaline rush.There are different other rides which you can enjoy. However some of the ride are not included within the entry ticket and you need to pay further to experience them. 
You will find some food stalls to have your meals as well.

Nice place to spend your weekend,Santaman_84,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,19-Nov-15,"Visited Nicco Park and Bowler's den on 11/15/2015 with wife friends and must say it was a satisfying experience(Visiting it after more than a decade). 

Located near Sector 5,Nicco Park is well connected from major parts of the city.There are plenty of buses as well as autos plying from Chingrighata.We reached there at around 3pm in the afternoon after having lunch from a nearby restaurant in sector 5. But there are some lunch/snacks(food court and individual stalls) options inside the park so visitors need not worry.The entry fee is Rs 170/- and visitors can combine some packages including ride tickets for both the park and wet o wild.There are also yearly discount packages available.Visitors can enquire about the different offers available(in the enquiry counter) before purchasing the tickets. 

Coming to the rides- The basic entry fee allows you 12 free rides(mostly for children) and the major attractions charge you nearly 50/60/70 bucks.The best (paid)rides according to me are:- 

1. Cyclone 
2. Water Coaster 
3. Dracula show(4D) 
4. River Cave(needs a makeover now) 
5. Flying Saucer 

There are plenty other attractions for kids(Merry go round,Carousal, Eiffel Tower,Aquarium,Toy train,Cable car,Striking cars,Lazy river ride) which they will surely enjoy. 

Would advise to arrive early in the morning since most of the rides are closed by 7:25pm.

However the staff present is not good, their mentality comes likes peoples should not do any activity here.

There was a big queue at the ticket counter. Then there was a big queue at tag counter (where they put a tag on your wrist). We took towels and lockers on rent (it was smooth). The men's changing area was big. The bathroom locks were not proper. I took my son to kids zone ... but he was not able to take a single ride. WHY ??? because the water was thrown with tremendous pressure (i found it unbearable, you can imagine how much pain it caused to a 3 years old). I requested the person on duty to reduce the pressure of water... he denied. So what my son did --- he went to the other pool and then on the stairs in the hill structure and then on the dance floor and the in the pool and so on. He spent nearly 3 hours in this way.

we having no option went out asking every second person where the printout can be done ... reached metropolitan society and got the printout done ...and by the time v were able to reach nicco park back again it was 5 pm .... 

the managment have no care for the fuel wastage , the energy wastage the harrasment of its customer and of its country... no care for how its behaviour effects the tourism of kolkata where 
nicco park is among the very few tourist place one visit in kolkata... out of three adult two where from delhi and only said that thank god atleast delhi do make use of tecnological progress.... 

its the duty of the niccopark managment that if they have advertized for somthing it should also make proper arrangement to provide service for the same n not spoil name of kolkata tourism in such manner........... it was a very shame worthy visit 

2nd bad experience was the behaviour of the person on duty ......... for the below attached picture ride .......... time apprx. 7pm ...... the eight year old kid wanted to take this ride and we found the stairs to reach its starting point ....... 
the person who was incharge of managing this ride off a sudden started shouting at us very badly that this is not the way to reach the starting point of this ride ...... we felt insulted by his way of our treatment.. and asked him to behave politly ... instead that person started arguing and calling names ....... he started giving gali and kept on giving galli for coming 5mins... the lady in our group kept on requesting to the managing person to let go the argument for we now do not want to take this ride anymore after such bad behaviour.... but the managing person even after such request dint stoped and continued his gallis .............. 
there was no sign board or any kind of obstecle on the gate from where we entered .... it so happen that in past that is 2013 march .. i myself had used that way/gate to reach the starting point of this ride............. and still we just had asked this person nothing else but to behave properly ... to use this gate was not our fault .... it was the managment fault not providing proper guidence....... to mislead ... n on top of it they misbehave .................... 

after this we went for boating ...... and was little amaze to c that ... though on 2nd that was a tuesday a weekday .. though nicco park was so scarcely populated there was line for boating.............. y so... because out of apprx.20 boats present there only 4 boats were let out............ rest were not being used ..we got our turn after 45mins.... and y this was hapening is the look out of the management...... 

basicaly small but the place is nice... if the managment can think n matain the park form the tourism point of view .... its an important part of kolkata tourism ... n the park managment needs to take pride in this fact n be humble istead of being proud of the fact and thus taking tourist for granted .......

Needs loads of improvement,Shreerupa B,"Leicester, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,22-Jul-14,"We have been visiting Nicco Park since school days.The park,rides,facilities have not changed much.Its the same rides.The food park is pathetic,was much better before.Newer rides needs to be introduced,the existing ones need maintenance.The toy train definitely needed some paint.The staff needs to be more welcoming.I went there after nearly 6 years and was not very happy.This was a favourite childhood spot with family.Though my son had a good time,he definitely was comparing it to the theme parks he had visited outside India and so were we.It definitely needs a face lift with newer rides,better food park.We went on a Sunday and the park was crowded,so getting numbers is not a problem .So why can't the authorities put in some money and efforts..it would definitely make a difference.

"There is so sense of architecthure, planning, designing or any professional setup",TheAllSeasonVisitor,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,11-Mar-14,"The people who created this place only received a huge huge land that nature can offer. Nothing at all human made created there is appreciable. Student architect, designers from proper school wouldn't even create something like this. 0 professionalism altogether. Village show. This place is far far below the international standards or even what you will be able to find in any developing Asian countries. To be honest, someone from west will be heavily embarrassed when they expect an amusement park and finds what is created here. More",May-13

Not worth visiting anymore.,Travellbug6,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,10-Jan-14,"It has become a money churning place. The condition of the place is in shambles. In the name of Carnival, the same things are repeated year after year. The gardens & lawns are not maintained. The place was once known for it's cleanliness, now it's filth all around. The garbage disposal bins are overflowing & the crows are strewing the same all across the place. No one is there to supervise. The condition of the rides are equally bad & I can recall accidents taking place some time back. The entry fees have been hiked exorbitantly & I recall it started with Rs. 5/- when I visited first as a young boy. The quality of the food is poor & flies are infested at the food court. I am sure the kitchen area is much worse where common visitors are not allowed. It's very unfortunate for a place once the city boasted about has gone for a toss for reasons best known to the management. More",Jan-14

The best option available in Kolkata,744saikatp,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,18-Nov-13,"Amusement park as always specially meant for children & people who are child at heart, here also no exception of that. Rides are ok, but seems that it will be better if they add new attraction. Few rides like the roller coaster will be better if they get cushioned sit or padded safety lock, bare steel rods as safety lock & wooden seats sometimes hurts. Washrooms are needed to be taken care of. Can not compare it with wonderla or essel world, but the best option available in Kolkata to have a fun filled weekend with the family specially if you have young kids.

Only standard amusement park in Kolkata,himadrigorai,"Brussels, Belgium",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,30-Aug-13,"Though Kolkata is a metro city, it has only one amusement park - that is Nicco park. This is not world class. Probably even not closer to the most popular ones in India. But being the only one it's surely one getaway for the adventure and fun seekers in Kolkata. 

The entry fee is bit on the higher side as there are very few free rides. They can rise the fee for the individual rides like Cyclone, River Cave, Water Coaster etc. But these rides are really good. Cyclone is probably India's best wooden roller coaster. More",May-13

Nostalgia at Rabindra Sarover,sumitkasera,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,28-Jan-19,"Kolkata was my birthplace – place where I was born and brought up and where I lived for about 15 years. So when some reunion request came more than 28 years after I had left the City of Joy, I came back to the city. I used to live bang opposite Rabindra Sarover for about 3 years. The years were marked by a table-tennis centre at the Rabindra Sarover Stadium where I used to learn the game. There used to also run a very slow toy train that had disappeared now. There were possibly few boating options too –not seen again! The street food options were customary to the city – the puchkas (Gol Gappas as they are called in Kolkata), Muri, and host of other savouries. And last but not the least, it was the lung of city – a place where morning walkers and evening joggers used to run around. About 28 years later, the place was almost the same as I had left it. Almost I would say! The growing plastic menace meant that I was not allowed to carry a polythene bag (even with stuff inside it) with no place to keep. Finally, I stuffed the bag below my shirt to carry it along. An NGT warning screamed that no puja, community event or social picnic could be performed at the venue. Inside there were muri walas selling muri (puffed rice with potato, onion and spices).... Kolkata was my birthplace – place where I was born and brought up and where I lived for about 15 years.

The most notable change of 28 years was that the bank of the lake was converted into a big promenade for people to stroll and have some fresh air. We could see many people walking or sitting alongside. There were dust bins around but I could see trash here and there – overall maintenance could have definitely been better. 

The water was not too dirty – many years ago we used to swim in it. A pair of ducks were making merry in the water. 

It was sheer nostalgia at Rabindra Sarover – a place to stay alongside a vast expanse of water, a promenade to take a leisurely stroll and a place to allow the lethargy of city to seep in and a place to savour the mesmerizing beauty of nature. More",Jan-19

Come here for walks or just jog,Chandan144,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,29-Jul-13,"This man made lake was previously called, Dhakuria Lakes. It stretches from Dhakuria Bridge on one side and the Tollygunge Railway Bridge on the other. There is a quaint little island connected by a hanging bridge and a whole lot of rowing clubs surrounding the lakes. 

The mornings and evenings are the times when the lakes are most populated. Morning walkers, evening walkers, lovers, the poet or that lonely guy....all throng to the lakes for a breath of fresh air. You may also encounter members of the 'Laughing Club', laughing away to glory as part of the 'live healthy' program.",Jan-13

Artificially Created Natural Abode – Rabindra Sarovar,GrainVodka,"Jodhpur, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,22-Jan-13,"You will be really astonished at the magnificence of the artificial water body that was earlier known as Dhakuria Lake and is now known as Rabindra Sarobar. 

Spread over 75 acres of land it is located near Salt Lake in South Kolkata. We found multiple picnic parties enjoying the lake bank, a welcome departure from the jungle of concrete and hassles of busy city life. 

For purpose of entertainment, visitors can resort to boating or swimming in the ponds. Another favorite pastime for the people visiting the lake is fishing in the lake water. Rabindra Sarobar is an excellent face for enjoying peace and tranquility of nature with family and friends. 

Moreover with the onset of winter beautiful weather is coupled with thousands of migratory birds and the lake side has also been beautified with lush green plantation. More",Aug-12

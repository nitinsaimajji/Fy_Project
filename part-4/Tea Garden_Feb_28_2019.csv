Absolutely waste of time and money,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,1-May-18,"People in places like Darjeeling should realize that their existence is merely on the cash inflow from the tourist. Of course, there is nothing wrong in cashing in on tourism but it should be ethical. My review is specifically about the tea garden and the roadside stores that are lined up along. 

Your driver will have a close nexus with the so-called tea stall selling Darjeeling tea dust. People at these stores are the most crooked and trickster breed. They lure you to buy these tea dust by offering you a cup of tea(chargeable) followed by the claims on how Darjeeling tea stands out from the rest. You being unaware will fall for this and end buying the product at an inflated price only to realize later that what you were sold was nothing more than S**t. You can hardly call it tea dust as it neither has any flavor or the texture of a tea dust 

So be wise and make sure that you buy it only from a renowned shop who is into legitimate business and not from these tricksters who have mushroomed along the roadsides of tea garden More",Apr-18
View is nice but shops are irritating,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,30-Apr-18,"The view and experience of the tea garden is nice but the shopkeepers get on your nerves. They have local unwritten rules that whichever car parks in front of whichever shop, you have to purchase from that shop.

Try some tea at Gopaldhara tea garden,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,1-Mar-18,"There are several tea gardens around Darjeeling, one of them (Happy Valley) being very close to the city boundaries. However, if you really want to enjoy the lush green beauty of a tea garden, I would suggest you keep a day for it and visit Gopaldhara (en route to Mirik). If you are a thrifty traveler (like me), go down to the Chowkbazar taxi stand and take a shared taxi to Mirik at just Rs. 100 per person per trip. However, direct taxis to Mirik are rare; in that case you can take a shared taxi to Sukhia Pokhri (60 rs per person per trip) and from Sukhia, take another shared taxi to Mirik. Get down at Gopaldhara, enjoy the greenery, and try some tea at their tea boutique at just Rs. 10 per cup. You can also buy some tea there; Gopaldhara produces excellent black tea (about Rs. 1500/kg). If you can spend a bit more, buy Makabari First Flush (springtime bloom) which is also available at the same boutique (MRP Rs. 550 for 100 gms). Then you can proceed to Mirik and then Siliguri. If you are coming back, the last shared taxi for Darjeeling leaves Mirik at 3:15 pm and will reach Gopaldhara in another 15 minutes, so prepare accordingly. After 4:30, it may be hard to get any shared taxi for Darjeeling, even from Sukhia Pokhri. More",Feb-18

Good for few snaps,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,10-Jun-17,"This is not a big tea garden. You can take few snaps (with the tea pickers dress, if you wish) and buy some Darjeeling tea packs from the shops situated around.",Jun-17
excellent,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,3-Jun-17,spend atleast 1 hr. here. nice scenic views. Also get into traditional dresses with photographs instant printouts at a very nominal charge.,May-17
Average place for a tea garden feeling,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,26-May-17,"A small piece of tea garden. One can go inside and take a few snaps.

Picturesque,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,25-May-17,You can see how tea leaves are grown. Take photographs wearing local dresses and enjoy the picturesque,May-17

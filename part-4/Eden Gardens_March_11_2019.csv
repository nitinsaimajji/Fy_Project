Garden of tranquility,bapta,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,5-May-17,"Eden Garden. This very word tingles the mind and the view of a stadium with it's enormous viewing gallery floats in front of our eyes. But no now I would review another Eden Garden from which this stadium gets its name. 
On the Western side of this World famous stadium lies a vast expanse of beautiful garden which is also called the Eden Garden. For some reason unknown to me this Garden is not a very popular spot for the locals nor for the visitors. Such a beautiful garden has very few admirers. 
Long ago when I was a kid I had seen a police band (music party) playing music every evening. It has stopped for some reason. Kolkata had lost such a beautiful event and only memories remains with the elders. 
Inside the garden everything is there which a garden can boast of . Beautiful and huge trees. Lawns , a lake , flowers and the most spectacular a Buddhist Pagoda. The original Pagoda was ruined with age but it was rebuilt to its former glory. 
Though very few people visit Eden Garden I would suggest all to visit this beautiful garden. More",Dec-16

Wonderful evening at Eden Gardens,Suman R,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,27-Apr-17,"We visited on 13.4.17. This was the first IPL match for my son. The extra attraction was the opening ceremony which was fabulous. My son enjoyed a lot & a KKR win was icing on the cake. 
However, I would like to point out that the food options were not up to the mark. We were in the stadium from 6:30 pm to 11 pm & hence had snacks & dinner there, but the options were limited. When we enquired about biriyani at around 9:30pm, the vendor mentioned that it was prepared at 1 pm. At least in the IPL season, CAB should ensure better catering facilities at the stadium.",Apr-17

Big Stadium,AshishLondon,London,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,24-Apr-17,"We watched KKR v/s GL match and the atmosphere was electrifying. The arrangements by the police were adequate where they provided sign boards at regular intervals, barricades at proper places, managed the traffic etc. 
The ground and related area was beautiful but the staircase & eating areas were dirty. Under constructed walls & staircases filled with dirt and kachra. 
Seats are quite close to each other which means you are bumping in other people while watching the match all the time and it was very difficult to get out of your seat if you needed to. Front seats weren't placed at proper heighted steps which meant one would need to adjust his/her view between the heads of people sitting in front rows. Children faced big issues where they couldn't see the match properly. 
Quite a few seats were empty but police didn't allow others to occupy those seats which was good and bad. Good because situation could be bad if those people who bought them showed up and bad because through out the match many of those seats remained empty. 
Overall, good experience watching a match in the iconic Eden Gardens stadium More",Apr-17

Worth a visit but getting tickets is confusing,michaelbT7411CS,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,17-Apr-17,"We visited this when staying in Kolkata and really enjoyed watching KKR play at their huge home stadium. Even if you are not a cricket fan (we aren't), this is still worth seeing. 

We tried to book tickets online but the website kept crashing. Instead we opted to go to the box office in person on match day to buy tickets. It took a long time to find the box office even after asking for directions from about a dozen people (directions given were all different...). The box office itself is not attached to the stadium but it is a series of steel cabins located in a field opposite the stadium. It is easier to spot going by the crowds as there are no sign posts at all. Once at the box office we ended up asking for tickets at multiple ticket offices as there appeared to be no logic to how the various tickets are sold by each booth. Eventually we got tickets (not the ones we were originally after as these had sold out) but the game was enjoyable nonetheless. 

My advice would be to buy tickets at least the day before if you really want the good seats. Also, factor in plenty of time to get to the stadium as no taxis would take us at around 7.30pm (match started at 8pm) due to the traffic congestion. More",Apr-17

I wish the CAB maintains the ground better so the history of cricket in this ground is there for everyone to see. A museum, a la Lord's, would have been inspirational. The seats were dirty and dusty.

For an international sporting arena, one expects a higher standard of amenities to be available. The toilet is one of those east meets west winged toilet bowls, which in itself is fine, except it is raised up on a platform meaning that the seat is easily two feet above the floor, with no way for someone with an injury like my myself to clamber up access it as everything around in was covered in slippery grime and filth. Only two toilets were accessible at the time, with no paper in either one (unacceptable for an international venue) and the floor was totally flooded, everything but the pathway in was apparently being used for storage, the lights were broken and I may have brain damage from excessive inhalation of bleach. The stadium is in a shocking state of disrepair, with layers of grime covering each seat, dust on every surface and exposed, broken, bent and rusted metal waiting to injure the unsuspecting visitor.

A great mistake !!!,Savison,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,22-Nov-16,"Eden Gardens of Kolkata is actually a beautiful garden park, adjoining the Ranji Cricket Stadium, which is mistakenly called the Eden Gardens, which it is NOT!! 

On the west of Ranji Stadium, and The Band Stand, lies this beautiful, peaceful and serene park. 
The two Eden sisters of Lord Auckland, Governer- General of India, laid out these public gardens in 1835. Adjoining a large artificial lake is a Burmese-style pagoda of exquisite design which was transported to Kolkata from Myanmar (Burma) and reconstructed in the garden. 

All India Radio Station, the Ranji cricket stadium and the Netaji Indoor stadium are inside the gardens. 
I have visited this lovely park, quite a few times in the last 40 years. I visited the park last Saturday, with a friend, to chat in peace and quiet. The upkeep has deteriorated over the years, but still, it has a beautiful ambiance, and I think all tourists to Kolkata must visit this haven of beauty and peace.And, for Kolkattans seeking a few hours of peace and quiet and contemplate life, this is the ideal place.

Love the Experience Every Time,samgogh,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,7-Aug-16,"If I am in Kolkata when India is playing at the Eden Gardens, you will find me visiting this awesome place. I have started taking my kids to watch at least two IPL matches every year and I must say that my family has fallen in love with the energy, the vibrant mood and the excitement in the atmosphere of this place. It is a good idea to travel with your car and park it either at the designated parking spots or near New Market (behind Grand Hotel) because when the matches end late at night it will be hard to get an Uber and the yellow taxis charge at least 2/3 times. In case you don't take your car walk down to the Grand Hotel where you will find policemen helping you to get on to cabs. 

Avoid the local sandwitches or other stuff sold at the ground ; rather go for the pizza hut stalls and other packed branded food. Water sachets are quite ok - I have never faced any issues over the last 20/30 years :-)) More",May-16

The stadium is one of the largest in the world. It earlier had an estimated seating capacity of nearly 100,000 spectators but that has now been reduced to around 66,000.

Fortunately some quick talking from my indian chaperone convinced them to take the battery only. I also had a make up mirror with me which was also taken, so be aware. The widths between the seat rows are very very narrow so it is extremely uncomfortable to sit particularly if the person in front of you keeps leaning back.

Be careful when leaving an event of this size too and keep close contact with your friends/chaperones and know exactly where your driver is going to be waiting as due to the sheer mass of people, the mobile tower was overloaded and there was no reception for mobile phones.

However, certain things drag it's exclusivity down - 
(1) Its very unclean. Make sure you get the right gates to get a cleaner environment. 
(2) the crowd can be extremely noisy. Though this very factor is considered as one of the attractive points of the stadium, some crowds can be extremely irritating for the peace-loving. 
(3) this is something I hate - you can't carry a water bottle inside. That's because of the crowd (point 2) - loves to hurl water bottles at the cricketers. Water pouches are available in the basement - you are supposed to pay Rs.10 only for 3 pouches - but you pay double (!!) - Rs.20.

Tempted by the Red Cherry in this Garden of Eden,forestloverNagpur,"Pune, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,4-Dec-12,"I loved the red cherry and the real cricket bat when I was a kid in the arms after watching the test matches at the Green Park in Kanpur as an infant......... 
Wondering what...? 
This love of the game made me play with the real cricket equipment as a kid of three or four. 
Later I opted for studies when I had a chance of getting in to the state Ranji squad. 
When in Kolkata during 1978 to 1983 it was nice to have gone and watched test matches and one dayers and also some international football matches. 
It was a wonderful experience in those days. 
Now I have not visited after the changes made. 
I love to watch the cricket matches in the ground on the TV. 
A very strong cricket knowing and cricket loving crowd. 
Looking out for the India England Test match. 
I saw it today getting ready for the India England Test match starting from the 5th December,2012. 
Maybe I may go to watch or watch on the TV due to other commitments. More",Dec-12

Why is this top rated?!,A380fan,"London, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,8-Nov-12,"I’m a little confused about whether the top spot rating was for the Stadium (er, it’s a stadium in India…corridors smelt of wee, and there’s rubbish and bird poo on the seats) or the gardens nearby (nicely mowed lawn, tall trees, no visitors). Either way, neither of these are really worth a visit (unless you're here for a cricket match).",Nov-12

Majestic Eden - Pride of Bengal,RudranilR,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,11-Oct-12,"Used to be one of the largest stadium of the world after MCG on basis of seating capacity (1 lakh) which now a days reduced to a mere 65k. This majestic ground boasts of its mad crowd, sportsman spirit, mexican wave and many more. It is the venue of many historic cricket matches ever played in the history of the game. One truly said that A cricketer is never complete unless he played atleast once in front of a fully packed Eden Garden crowd. They will love you, clap for you, dance for you & will shout their heart out for you. These all will come as an electrified package in presence of an outstanding environment. Home ground of the best ever captain of India - Sourav Ganguly. Also homes the IPL team of the city KKR. 

No words can really describe the actual ambiance inside until one is physically present there. Its awesome & marvellous. 

But there are a few things of concern such as Toilets are always stinking and not well maintained. Its better to buy package drinking water instead opting for the tap water which a may be contaminated due to lack of maintenance of the tank. 

And BEWARE of over-tight, over-hyped, ridiculous, callous & useless security arrangements which might stop you to carry even coins, water bottles, baby foods also inside the gallery. And no senior officials present to complain about these foolish & stupid personnel. More",May-12

Possibly the best thing to do in Kolkata,sam2013,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,7-Oct-12,"If you want to experience Kolkata at its passionate, fervent best then a trip to Eden Gardens is an absolute must - even for non-cricket lovers. 

For IPL matches, the raucous, fun crowd is as eclectic and diverse as the atmosphere is hot, loud and electric. When the match slows, conversation and banter flows with the people around you and there is perhaps no better setting to see Kolkatans kick back and have fun. 

The atmosphere is especially good when India or KKR win and when shah rukh khan pays a visit.",

The Mecca of Cricket,Probhat N,"Kolkata, West Bengal, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,22-Sep-12,"EDEN GARDENS, without doubt, is the "" Mecca of cricket "". Ask any international cricketer from any part of the globe who has played on this fabled venue - and he will vouch for the title. 

For the Calcuttans ( Kolkattans ? ) like us it's the ' neighbour's envy, owner's pride ' ! Of course, it is on of the greatest attraction of Kolkata, particularly for the sports lovers. It is the world-famous cricket ground in Kolkata, just besides the magnificient river Ganges and near to Esplanade - the heart of Kolkata. It is the nostalgic venue of many great and historic Test cricket battles, as also of many thrilling Limited Over matches and Tournaments. Who can ever forget the glorious moments of the record partnership between Dravid and Laxman on this ground, or the historic Test win against Mike Brearly's England, or the inspired fight of Team India against the mighty Australia of Steve Wagh under the stewardship of our beloved Dada?And of course, the greatest sensation of all - the thunderous applause of one lakh-strong crowd when Sunny or Vishy steps down on the ground to bat or when Sachin completes another century. The sporty crowd is equally generous to appreciate any great batting, bowling or fielding effort displayed by the visiting opponents. 

Indeed, watching a cricket match at the Eden Gardens is a life time experience and amemory to cherish forever ! More",Feb-12

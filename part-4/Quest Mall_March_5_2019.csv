Make no mistake,that this is just another mall in the city,but way to expensive than anywhere else in Kolkata. I'll give my own experience when I went to buy jeans from Levis store situated inside the Mall. One jeans which caught my fancy was selling for Rs 3600 after discount. I found the price ridiculous. Hence walked away,simply saying didn't like it. Next day bought two jeans of Levis staruss,same model 511 from Mtero Cash and Carry for Rs 1400 and Rs 1600 !! So I got two jeans for the price of one,from the same Company ! Why spend more here ?You will if you want to splurge your undisclosed income ! 
' 
Restaurants are expensive too. Parking space is huge but refrain from taking your S-class and 7 series as the access way up and down parking lot is a winding way,and you actually may get stuck ! I saw a S-350 getting stuck. 

The place is a hangout zone for locals. Hnece gets crowded in the evenings as well as on weekends. 

Frankly,I have been there.Probably won't visit again More",Sep-17

All under one roof,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,1-Jun-17,"One of the main reasons I frequent this mall so much, is that everything is literally under one roof. Theres a department store in the basement, snack food like popcorn, kulfi, milkshakes etc, a party shop, coffee shop. The ground floor has luxury shopping and boasts brands such as canali, jimmy choo, Michael kors, Swarovski, thecollective, etc. The other floors have regular brands like Fabindia, ritu Kumar label, Benetton, Mac, Calvin Klein, Claire's etc. The kids section is on the 3rd floor - little shop, uspa, holdover kids etc. 
There's also a multiplex -INOX and a food court which offers quite a variety - from chaat to Chinese and fast food. Besides, this there are other coffee shops in the mall as well. The fifth floor has fine dining and pubs - Irish house, Bombay brasserie, serafina and the city's only Michelin star restaurant - yauatcha 
The only annoying part is the crowds taking selfies and blocking the foyer on holidays and weekends and the mismanaged parking during peak hours. More",Jun-17
Great place to shop in Kolkata,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,31-May-17,"This actually the best place to shop in Kolkata if you don't mind paying extra. There are quite a few outlets of international brands and getting it all under the same roof is certainly convenient.

Has several upscale brands like Gucci, Jimmy choo, Pink, Canali etc as well as few of the lower ends too. Prices are on the higher hand relatively speaking. Mall is huge with plenty of space. Movie theatre is a plus with the latests films being played. There is a chilis on the upper floor which was a delicious treat. The food court is average. 
Very family friendly as well as for couples hanging out on a weekend.",May-17
Brand names galore!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,30-Apr-17,"Excellent place to get brand name stuff. This is the only mall in Kolkata for some of these brands. While it is good for shopping brand names, Quest Mall does not have the ambience that South City Mall or even Acropolis mall has. People visit malls not just for shopping but also to have fun such as a good place to rest your heels when you are tired. I find Quest very cramped for space. To begin with, parking is extremely cramped and the circular driveway is so narrow that it is downright scary, if you happen to have a big car. I wish the management had been more innovative with the Foodcourt, starting from the design, seating arrangements, selection of food stores and variety available. If you are looking for a good cup of Capuccino, there is no good cafe in the main food court ... there is a good one - Q33 - but you will have to go to the ground floor for it. Au bon pain is there in the food court but it is not exactly a coffee place. There are some good restaurants, though. Basement has Spencers supermarket (hyper store) but space wise it is a smaller version of the one in South City. Starmark bookstore is also located in the basement, but again the design of the space is such that it does not generate the excitement and interest as it could have....

The other places like masala kitchen serves some good Indian food",Apr-17
Out of Kolkata experience!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,9-Apr-17,"The place looks like it has been planted from another city if not another world. It is just not Kolkata... It's bright, glitzy, modern, and has some uber luxury brands and a luxurious 6-screen multiplex - the cherry on top. 

The only downside is that there are some stores in the mall that don't fit in but that's a small price to pay. Naturally, stores do not do the same business that they do in Delhi or Mumbai as a few of them confirmed. But it is a must-do in Kolkata if you have the time beyond the touristy things and the local food. Limited merchandise, but top quality labels and fantastic ambiance. It just refreshes you for another day in this beautiful but grimy city! More",Apr-17

Quest for Quality.............,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,9-Oct-16,One of the best malls in kolkata in terms of quality and brands.

A dazzling jewel.....,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,12-Sep-16,"....in a not very impressive setting. Meaning that the neighborhood around it is as rundown and decrepit as it was before this dazzling palace of a mall was plonked down in its midst. 
Still this is a cool and eye catching haven where locals and visitors can get a welcome break from the relentless heat and humidity of the city while browsing, shopping, snacking, watching a movie or simple chilling out - literally. 
While the locals may be priced out of most of the ""phoren"" merchandise on display in the very upscale stores. A few like Spencer's and Lifestyle do cater to the upwardly mobile middle class particularly when they have their very attractive sales. The food court and multiplex are also good options for snacking and entertainment without burning a hole in your pocket. This place is close to my maternal residence and so I visit often when in the city. 
BTW I also learnt that the mall is indeed wheelchair accessible and spotted one in a corner athough I did not utilize this service despite having a fractured foot. More",Aug-16
International standards mall,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,12-Sep-16,"A lovely mall, (almost) up to international (s'pore/dubai) standards. Up market, so be prepped to butn some cash.

"High end mall, but the hypermarket is a daily draw",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,22-Aug-16,"This is a huge mall with most of the uber luxury brands present here. At the same time it contains two mid-range stores, Spencer's and a clothing store occupying five floors, among the largest in the country. The Spencer's hypermart is huge, spanning the entire basement, and offering every conceivable household item. The food section has to be noted for the range and quality of items, from fresh fish, in-house bakery, a butchers, to fresh, frozen and canned foods sourced from all over the world, plus the daily essentials. If you live nearby, then this is the best place to buy your daily grocery needs. 

The top floor food court has restaurants to fit every palate, but no cheap eats. The mall is worth visiting just for the food choices available here. Cleanliness and maintenance is top-notch. There is an attached massive multi-level parking, with direct access into the mall. 

The luxury brand shops are eye catching but not for every pocket. They are good to window shop, but the great food and the Inox multiplex make this mall a must visit destination. More",Oct-15

Entertainment: Inox here is pretty good, there seems to a video parlour for kids too

The shops here are all high end and i might as well be shopping in an international duty free section of an airport. 
Too many security and staff here make it feel claustrophobic, but the air conditioning was a welcome relief. 

We did find a wine shop here and bought some Indian red wine which was pretty good, though when we went to get a drink upstairs it was not a good choice. 
I recommend that you steer clear of the Green Mango Ice Gola unless you have seriously damaged your taste buds somewhere else. 

The mall is great for those with too much money or those who just want to gawp in to expensive shops... but for the average person, head to the Forum Mall, it's less high end but much nicer in my opinion. More",Sep-15

Now, I am not trying to generalize things, so to be little specific, there were no rules and regulations for running a shopping mall in place and hence its like the ""Purge"" every day. 1. Go to food court and who ever can push more wins gets ahead. (No clear line demarcated) 2. Take the lift and people will flatten you over the wall (no max per limit notice) 3. While paying the parking fee there is high chance that you might have to wait for 30 min to just pay and get out of the mall. 4. Be always steady on your feet as you may never know when people will just give you a hard push and you might loose your balance and then you can take your call and decide where you want to fall. I generally don't give such a negative feedback as I judge less and try to experience life as it comes, but my last visit with my family in this mall was not so good experience and specially with all its care, I can still not mitigate the risk of unruly horrible crowd.

Just another swanky shopping mall,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,9-Jan-15,The Quest Mall is like just another swanky shopping mall in a metro. Both the national brands and few international brands are available here.,Jul-14
Great mall..,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,4-Jan-15,"Quest mall is located close to Park Circus / Beck Bagan area of Kolkata. Its hard to miss and more or less every local (eg: cab drivers or people) knows it. 
The mall has lots of famous brands to choose from. It has a big Lifestyle store, lots of restaurants, a large and great food court. Other items would include Inox Cinema, The Thai Spa, A N John (saloon), Spencers, Starmark, etc. 
There is plenty of (paid) parking space, though best place to park would be close to the mall entrance doors, else you have to navigate through another set of elevators. If you're planning to go to Spencer's Hypermart, then do park at the basement. 
On the downside, it gets really crowded in the weekends and holidays and crowd isn't that great. More",Jan-15

Classy mall in a rather down market area of Kolkata,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,12-Dec-14,"Who would have thought that the busy down market Beck Bagan area of Kolkata would have a world class mall.In the ground floor of the mall you will be excused if you think you were in an upmarket mall of east London or South Delhi.For ,you will see most famous brands like Armani,Rolex,Gucci,etc.housed there.There is even a branch Michelin star Indian restaurant of London on the top floor just above the food court.The mall is tastefully decorated.There is adequate parking space and you can pay for parking fees inside the mall in kiosk just before leaving the mall.The elevators for the first timers are rather confusing.In some cases you have to take two sets of lifts from parking to get into the mall.There is even a valet service with dedicated car parking floor.The food court has decent options but gets really crowded on weekends.Chillirs has a branch which is usually crowded.Do not miss the coffee shop in the second floor(coffee bean & tea leaf).Mr. Khaitan will do well to fire his lousy employees in the au bou pain outlet in the fourth floor.Inox on the fourth floor is our favorite destination for movies.Lifestyle and Spencer seems to be the anchor stores.Sadly you will find mostly people from neighborhood coming in to the mall to click photographs against the suave background rather than serious shoppers.All in all a mall Kolkata can be proud of but for the locality.Toilets are under lot...

For High End Brands!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,13-Nov-14,"Kolkata lacked a mall which had brands of international standing. Quest tries to fill that void. It has stores like Gucci, Armani, Burberry, and more. You will also find Indian brands like Satya Paul, Fab India, and Masaba. 

This shopping arcade sells only luxury items. So coming here is not going to give you an everyday shopping experience. The staff in the stores will treat you with care, and spend ample time with you. The items available are exquisite and appealing. My husband and I ended up buying shirts, a blazer, shades, etc. Just remember to carry your credit card when you come to shop at Quest!",Oct-14
Nice ambience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,8-Nov-14,Very neat and clean and spacious. Has an extra edge over other shopping malls in the city.The obelisk in the front entrance is really superb.,
Appealing!!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,3-Nov-14,"I've liked this wide attractive, cool decorated shopping mall. The ground floor decoration was eye catching. Enjoyed Indian food and 3D movie, Noah at Insignia, inside, it was really WOW to watch that movie there. All branded products available, though, didn't buy anything :P.

Grt place to shop...,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,1-Nov-14,I shopped in Quest during my stay and it was amazing...u will find brands like Burberry and all......,Oct-14
Huge But Void,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,31-Oct-14,"Its a huge mall, very classy and sophisticated with conglomeration of top notch International Brands!. But as far as shopping is concerned, this place is very disappointing. The place is beautifully decorated but I guess there are hardly 3-4 stores per floor. Most importantly people from Kolkata do not buy stuffs from Gucci and Armani and Micheal Kores throughout the year, so for regular shoppers like us this place is a complete no no. The mall hardly consist any store as such from where one can buy clothes and shoes for daily office or college wear. I think its very important for this Mall to incorporate brands like Big Bazar,Westside,Pantaloons,Vero Moda,Shopper Stop in order to increase sales and pull more and more crowds!! More",Aug-14
Classy,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,25-Oct-14,"with a wide array of branded stores, it's quite a dream.

There were discounts which were offered and the offers were lucrative .its clean and spacious as well.",Oct-14
Luxury Redefined !!!!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Oct-14,If you are a high spender in brands then this is the place to ho for.

Luxurious,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,16-Oct-14,"Another high class mall in Kolkata which houses only luxurious and international brands. Quest mall has some descent brands including Gucci, Breitling, Tag Heuer, Burberry, Canali, Emporio Armani, Villeroy & Boch, Furla, TUMI, Michael Kors, Omega, Paul Smith, Rolex. LifeStyle is also located in Quest Mall. 

Quest Mall offers a six-screen multiplex INOX and also has several fine dine options like Chilli, Au Bon Pain, Bombay Brasserie.",Sep-14
Overall good,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,15-Oct-14,"The only purpose of writing this review for Quest is that although this mall is world standard (internally at least), there are a lot of ""wrong"" people moving around the mall. Due to it's location (Park Circus area), a large number of bad elements loiter around the mall creating nuisance for the families and especially the girls. The mall authorities must look into this and take steps to deter these ""bad elements"" from entering the mall. 

One way is to check the dress code and levy an entry fee. The genuine buyers will not mind paying the entry fee and it can be reimbursed to them by the respective shops when they make a purchase. There should also be more security in place. More",May-14
An attempt to bring international brands,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,7-Oct-14,This mall is a good attempt to bring international brands to kolkata. If u r a serious brand shopper visit the store in early hours to avoid rush by mere window shoppers. Nothing that great about ambience and no place for non-brand shoppers,
Get together,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,4-Oct-14,"Just wow for de place , it's location iz great no problem for vechicle for any where , just a small suggestion security little bit weak .

Quest of thief and cheaters,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,27-Sep-14,"The ambiance of the mall is good very beautiful but beware when we purchasing something from anywhere specially from food court they are cheaters..... On my fast and probably last visit I gave Rs. 1000 the cashier standing in food court counter for Rs. 500 food card.. When we ask for the change that guy told us you have your food I will give you back your change when you will submit your card.... When we get back to him and ask for the refund he told me he has already given us back the balance 500.....

Luxury Mall in the Heart of Kolkata,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,14-Sep-14,"A latest entrant in the 'Mall-Ecosystem' of Kolkata. Situated in the heart of the city (near Park Circus 7-point crossing), the Mall has paid a lot of attention to its decor and the choice of Retail brands. 
The huge revolving glass door at the entrance has caught the fancy of the average Kolkatan entering the mall 
The effort has been to position itself as a 'Luxury Mall', with the likes of Gucci, Armani, Burberry, Paul Smith, etc acquiring retail space at the mall. 'Lifestyle' is the Anchor-retailer of the Mall and has the maximum floor space (spread across 4 levels). 
The Food Court is big (not as huge as in South City) and has good Food options. But would prefer more options. 
The Top-floor has some great Restaurants and a Pub (the Irish House), which can be pretty crowded on weekends! 
In short, Quest is a great addition to the city and the City needed it! More",Sep-14
A Mall for Brand Lovers,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,12-Aug-14,"This is the international standard mall especially for brand lovers where you will find branded clothes, shoes, bags, beauty products etc under the same roof, unless worth visit for others.

Impressive,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,29-Jul-14,"I was here in the mall twice in the last 2 months.The location is good,the parking spacious but the parking fee is quite a bit higher than other places.What I liked was that it had good mix of shops of all kinds ranging from really luxury brands to affordable brands.The kids shops at the 4th floor is what we liked the most,all major kids brands were there.Its like all under the same roof.Compared to the other malls in the city it hardly had much crowd though we went on weekends.Hopefully the mall management would add more brands in the near future to make it the ultimate mall in the city.Way to go but definitely good addition for the city.

Good Mall,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,21-Jul-14,"I pass by Quest Mall almost everyday as it is on my way to work. It's a beautiful mall, best in Kolkata so far. I have visited once to watch a movie at INOX. It was good. What I don't like about this place is most of the young people hanging around every time unnecessarily. It has become a meeting point rather than a shopping mall. The location is not ideal.",
Just like other malls....,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,9-Jul-14,Its just like other malls of Kolkata but needs a little more attention to the public needs and hygiene factor of the washrooms. Prices are still pretty high but its quite same for every mall in the city. Food court needs to be added with a few more options.,Jun-14
Excellent but expensive,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,1-Jul-14,The mall is fantastic with excellent ambience. There are so many branded shops and products. But things are very expensive there and some more restaurants should be added.,Jun-14
Just Hype...Not Even Basic Things Right,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,30-Jun-14,"Been To quest Mall on sunday around 11 am For a movie @ INOX Quest Mall . after the movie decided to have my lunch also at the mall but..... 

Being the newest mall in city and one which created a lot of hype lacks basic things 

1st when i was parking my car at level P4 a street dog was roaming there, i was quite surprised by and security guard was quick to reply - kya karen sir jab tab aa jaten hai. 

2nd toilets are in very poor state. on 4th floor opposite food court cash counter there is a toilet and was really shocked to see only 2 urinals in men's toilet with no soap dispenser and no hand dryer. now days even in a movie hall you expect these basic amenities but did not find them in a mall which calls itself a luxury mall. i tried contacting mall officials but could not locate. 

3rd - Parking lay out is really miserable. separate lifts for parking levels and that too available after a long wait. not even a single security out side exit gate 5 to manage the cars leaving the mall and that results a complete chaos on the road. 

its a request to concerned people to look after these small issues but of big importance and an advice to fellow commuters. More",Jun-14
INOX,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,29-Jun-14,Fuel recharge served stale and unpalatable food. On repeated requeat the popcorn remained soft and water warm. Very little concern on part of the staff,

International standard mall,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,1-Jun-14,"The only mall in Calcutta which is of international standard in terms of decor and design, and of course in terms of brands on offer.

Brand and High End Shopping,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,29-May-14,"New in Kolkata, this mall is in the heart of the city and is a cool place where you can disappear from the soaring temperatures of the city.

Good mall but exits to parking floors a concern,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,21-May-14,Very well done mall and good blend of shopping experience and restaurants.

Took my 6 yrs old son to watch Amazing Spiderman 2 to Inox at Quest Mall. Chose the Insignia Lounge as the venue for the movie. The waiting lounge was nice and comfortable...but lots more was still to come. As we were greeted into the theatre, the spacious interiors really brought a smile to our faces. The seats were the next surprise. My son was elated to find the seats that were soooo comfortable with sliding leg rests and extremely soothing couches. The extra sized tables were a delight and great help with the super delicious caramel popcorn.....coffee can be improved though.

Indeed, a lot of international brands to choose from. By Kolkata standards, it is spacious and looks quite attractive- both inside and out. Well connected by bus, tram and auto. No nearest Metro though. The Food Court at the top is nice though it gets crowded at peak hours. It is not that kind of swanky mall that you may find in Gurgaon or Delhi but as I mentioned, by Kolkata standards, it is nice. I would go back again for all my shopping and other needs. The movie theatre is also the first of its kind in Kolkata- what money can offer. As of now, there is no other nearby Mall to challenge it in any way. More",Apr-14

With several stores neatly organised on different floors, you need time on your hands to explore all or most of them.

An interesting experience was the 11D Adventure Plex. Two back to back movies with special effects were played for 20 minutes. Though the leaflet promised a variety of special effects - bubble, aroma, thunder, snow, butt/leg ticklers, lightning, air-jet etc, all we experienced were hot air, butt/leg ticklers and water sprays. The movie ""Adventures of Alibaba"" and ""Roller Coaster"" were the ones we were able to view. However, with limited special effects and the short duration, the ticket price of Rs.250 appeared to be a bit steep. (After all, you can catch a movie at a multiplex with much less than this!)

The only Indian Railway so high,MelissaDsouza,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,23-Feb-19,"These trains work on engine and they have particular timings you shouldn't be expecting some great views since the place is not so clean, definitely a 1 time visit to the world's heritage.",Sep-18
Bollywood toy train,prrateek,"Hyderabad, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,22-Jan-19,"The legendary , UNESCO world heritage toy train of dhr famed for steam engine is definitely a must visit. The station is located conveniently in the city, priced at 1430 rs per person for steam version is reminiscent of big Bollywood movie songs, taking now thru cramped streets of otherwise scenic Darjeeling. A tea service and peppy Bollywood songs would add a little more charm. 
The train journey starts at prefixed intervals and takes almost 2 hours to return covering batasia loop, ghoom, ghoom railway museum ( 20 minutes). 
Despite congested seating, coal flying...dhr is definitely a fairy tale experience",Jan-19
A glory lost to urbanization,parveen_ahlu,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,19-Jan-19,"While earlier the joy of sitting in the toy train would have been unforgettable, today this has lost its charm...primarily because Darjeeling as a town is dirty and there really is no joy in sitting in the train. The station as well as in Ghoom are historical landmarks, though.",Jan-19
Heritage Ride - Must do activity,sreenisarma,"Hyderabad, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,16-Jan-19,Took the steam engine train ride from Darjeeling-Ghoom-Darjeeling. The ride is exceptional with stop at Batsia Loop as well. Coaches are well maintained and timings are honored. Booked it in advance thru IRCTC. The stations at Darjeeling and Ghoom have lot of heritage and UNESCO certified as well.,Dec-18
Must go for it,Pooja_Vikesh,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,14-Jan-19,I had a great great ride in this heritage toy train. I took a drive from Darjeeling to Ghoom. You will see beauty of Darjeeling going in this train. It moves really slow which increases the sight seeing value. A must for all the tourists.,Jan-19
Good train ride through Batasia Loop,490amlanr,"London, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,5-Jan-19,"It was a cold morning and we had a ride on a train which was v slow but powered by steam engine. Great views, v few seats. We booked 4 seats and could only get a waitlist for 5th and do one of us had to stand. The waiting spots were scenic and nice. The train museum was good too.",Dec-18
Queen of hills- darjeeling toy train,JayantSathe,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,5-Jan-19,"Toy train of Darjeeling has been accorded the UNESCO World Heritage status operating on narrow gauge since 1880 is still in full operation offering scenic beauty on both sides during its run.Steam engine pulling mini coaches managing various curves at snail pace.

Long and boring,hjkort,"Vienna, Austria",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,2-Jan-19,"The 7 hours ride took almost 10. The first 2.5 hours are interesting then it gets boring. Better to get off the train then and take a taxi down. Seats, even in first class, are uncomfortable for such a long ride.",Jan-19
Best experience.,Sharadtarde,"Pune District, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,23-Dec-18,One of the great experience in Darjiling. The view from the window of nature is unforgatable. Only you have to book online before atleast 2 week .,Dec-18

Definitely a ride to take to enjoy nature",Jun-18
Not Worth the Money,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,30-Nov-18,"No need to pre-book tickets....not many people visits this now a days.... 

Joy train ride Very expensive..not worth the money and time.. 

If you really wants to enjoy toy train...take train from NJP to Darjeeling... 

When traveling by Diesel engine, you can see that most of the tourist covers their nose due to smoke... 

Invest the time at some other place...train travels on busy road most of the path",Oct-18
Journey of a lifetime,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,14-Nov-18,"Darjeeling Himalayan Railway was a journey of a lifetime with such incredible sceneries that cannot be described unless you have first hand experience of it. The views were simply out of this world and breathtaking. Darjeeling Himalayan Railway is a must for anyone visiting Darjeeling, with the sceneries itself being the number one reason to travel and meet some unique people as well. The only negative being that it really needs maintenance, but other than that a fantastic experience.",Nov-18
Good Railway,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,14-Nov-18,Darjeeling Himalayan Railway is a very popular in Darjeeling. It is a heritage thing in West Bengal.,Oct-18
Just horrible!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,12-Nov-18,"Darjeeling hasn't got a lot to offer and what it does have - in this case the Unesco recognised 'toy' train - is to be avoided as a passenger and probably avoided altogether. 
We took the ironically named 'joy ride' which cost a lot, is mercifully brief and, in my opinion, should be shut down. 
This train simply follows the already congested road, spews smoke everywhere and is deafening. The two stops are a joke. 
If you need to see these trains, do it at the Darjeeling station. They're much better observed from outside of the carriages. 
Very disappointing and a bit of a ripoff.",Nov-18
An amazing thing but not maintained,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,5-Nov-18,"I loved the steam and small gauge diesel railway of Darjeeling. 

The station and yard are in the main road but it’s definitely seen better days. 

If this was anywhere else in the world it would have been cherished and lovingly restored - but sadly this is never been maintained to the levels it should be and it’s therefore quite saddening to see the general disrepair of what could be one of the worlds great narrow gauge railways. 

If you are planning to ride the railway, remember - from Siliguri to Darjeeling the train leaves at 08:30 and it takes around 7 hours to get to Darjeeling.",Nov-18
Toy Train in West Bengal,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,18-Oct-18,"The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, also referred to as the DHR, and lovingly called the 'Toy Train', is a 2 feet narrow gauge train that runs between New Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling, in West Bengal, India. The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway provides significant transport links between various parts of the Darjeeling hills and lower plains and is a piece of sheer engineering inventiveness and vision.",Aug-18
Too pricey & Overly Hyped,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,17-Oct-18,Overly hyped... Could definitely improve the service in return to the amount charged... atleast a cup of Darjeeling Tea can be served to go along with Heritage ride concept,Oct-18
Darjeeling visit,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,13-Oct-18,"Old Victorian styled steam engine is the speciality with the ticket price being Rs 1300 and for Diesel engine being Rs 800. For novelty factor, it is a must visit.",Oct-18
Toy Train,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,10-Oct-18,Its an amazing experience travelling in the heritage - Darjeeling Himalayan Toy Train. Its a must visit railway station.,Sep-18
"Joy ride, not worth the price",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,4-Oct-18,"The hill train is an unique one running in the world and is known for the innovative engineering feats. The Darjeeling station is a cute one. However, as far as the joy ride goes, the price of Rs. 805 per person for diesel engine and Rs. 1300 per person for steam engine is quite steep. The journey is a short one to Ghum station (half hour stop) and a ten minutes stop in the famous Batasia loop. Since the journey is through the crowded city do not expect any good views. The Ghum musuem is interesting to people interested in history, but may be uninteresting to kids. The ride provides a unique experience of traveling alongside shops, houses and cars. But if you are expecting great views you will be disappointed. More",Oct-18
Heritage Railway,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,3-Oct-18,"Darjeeling Railway Station is the highest in India, situated at an altitude of over 2200 meters. The Darjeeling-Himalayan Railway runs trains, both Diesel and Steam every 2 hours alternatively. The charges are pretty steep at Rs.800 for Diesel train and Rs.1300 for Steam train. The journey itself is very unique as we travel along-side cars and two wheelers and into some very picturesque places. At times the train pass through the market place! There is a memorial on the way and the train stops for a 10 mins there for you to take pics and stops at Ghum for 30 mins- where you can a railway museum..., which is not interesting. And being a round trip, the train takes the same route back to Darjeeling. Interesting trip, but the charges seem a wee bit high. More",Aug-18
Amazing,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,23-Sep-18,"I went to Darjeeling Himalayan Railway. A visit to the city of Darjeeling is incomplete without a joyride at the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway toy train. Moving at a snail pace over the hilly terrain, it is an experience no one wants to miss. It is great place to go.",Sep-18
Amazing experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,16-Sep-18,Amazing experience to cherish the heritage of railways. A visit to tiger hill in a clear weather and Himalayan railways should be the only items to be added in the itenerary of darjeeling. My kid enjoyed a lot.,Sep-18
"A train journey on road, in woods, touching the lives and vanishes inside clouds...",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,14-Sep-18,"DHR is a fascinating word. It takes you to some places, where you have never reached before. It takes you through some frames that you have never seen before. 
Board the train from Kurseong. The city ends when the train goes between the church and Kurseong Tourist Lodge. Then the magic starts. The magic of whistle and steam takes you into an antient times. The forest of deodar makes the path for you. The train goes through the Nepali basti, passes the waterfall, crosses the wet road now and then. Sometimes you depart from the train and run pass by pass the train. Then only you disappears in the sudden cloud. The train also gets vanished. Only the dim headlamp declares the toy train is running. 
Tung-Sonada-Ghum. These are the stations you stop before reaching Darjeeling, the city of cloud. The train reaches at Batasia loop in between Ghum and Darjeeling. If you can’t manage the tickets, go to Batasia loop at train time. Sit over a bench and watch the train come climbing a loop. 
Darjeeling Himalayan Railway can be the only thing for which one can come to Darjeeling. If you come, don’t miss it. More",Aug-18
The living legend,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-Jul-18,"The World Heritage Railway is for ever new to me and fortunately at least one train is operational between New Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling stations. It takes very lng time to reach the destination, but experience is lifetime. Z reversing points are thrilling and Museum in the upstairs of Ghum station is worth visiting. Art gallery at the waiting room of Sukna station is also fascinating. For both up and down trains lunch is available in Tindharia station.",Jul-18
The Joyride,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,14-Jul-18,"It was amazing to see a steam engine pulling two small bogies for an exciting joy ride. Got tickets booked thru IRCTC however tickets are available at window in off season in July/August. It was from Darjeeling to Ghum station and back with a 10 min break at Batasia. We wish that break be increased to 25 mts as one hour break at Ghum has no need. You can see railway museum in 15 mts. 
Otherwise just enjoy sight seeing on way.",Jul-18
The joyride,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,5-Jul-18,We booked a joyride in the old steam engine through IRCTC. It was from Darjeeling to Ghum station and back with a 10 min break at Batasia loop and half an hour at Ghum station. The feeling of course is unforgetable and takes you back to a different era. Its an engineering marvel that has withstood the test of time. You can avoid the slight hindrance of fine coal particles if you book the joyride in a disel engine( it ischeaper too) but then you willmiss the real thril.,Jun-18
Hill passenger railway,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,3-Jul-18,Darjeeling Himalayan Railway is declared as world heritage site by UNESCO.The narrow gauge railway is between New Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling. It is the most outstanding example of 'hill passenger railway'.The toy train passes in a loop like pattern at Batasia loop to counter sharp descent(140 feet).It is an engineering marvel.For most of the tourists it is a nostalgic ride when they visit Darjeeling.,May-18
Not an amazing Experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,3-Jul-18,"When people go for Toy Train ride, they expect that when they'll be inside the train, they'll be able to see some nice views and some exciting experience but in actual the train just goes on the road from which you have entered the darjeeling city, no beauty to see from train. So if somebody is going to darjeeling and just see its engine, take pictures already parked on station as it is historical.",Jun-18
Toy train enjoyed,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,29-Jun-18,It's a beautiful in Darjeeling. The second world highest railway station is here. Narrow gauge railway based on zig zag and loop line. Nice view from inside.,Jun-18
Nostalgic steam train ride,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,26-Jun-18,"Although the ride itself and the views it offers are nothing extraordinary, the whole experience is very nostalgic, especially with the steam train, reminding you of your childhood. The train feels like a toy train (and is named so) and chugs along slowly through the busy streets of Darjeeling up to Ghoom station. Except the war memorial at Batasia Loop, there's not much interesting to see on the way and you might get a little bored after a while (especially while coming back from Ghoom). Even the nostalgia wears off by the time you return back to Darjeeling after 2 hours :-). The tickets can be booked online from IRCTC website and it's better if you do that during peak season. The steam train ride is quite costly as compared to the diesel one, but is a decent value for money. The train bogies & seats are decently maintained (by Indian railway standards) but the stations and the whole experience could be managed little better. More",May-18
Historical place,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,24-Jun-18,The railways are too slow but they are famous for their steam engine which were made by Britisher. Which makes it best.,May-18
Worth Visiting...,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Jun-18,"Darjeeling Himalayan Railway is one of the tourist hotspot. 
And perhaps it is one of the UNESCO World heritage site. 
It is the oldest railway system in India.",Jun-18
Awesome experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Jun-18,"Give the Himalayan Railway half a day, and it won't disappoint. We booked online through IRCTC site (for the 2 hour return trip, which is preferable for most tourists, choose DJ for to and DJRZ for return). It's a relaxed journey through the city and hills and takes it's own sweet time to start. Don't hurry it. Luck was on our side, as though the sun played hide and seek, it never rained. At Ghoom, they should have some nice places for local snacks. The museum was small but nice. Overall it's a nice leisurely trip that you should not miss.",May-18
A Lifetime Experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,22-Jun-18,"We took two hours joyride on the DHR Steam Engine. I booked the tickets on irctc website one month in advance. It was an amazing experience to see how a steam engine works. The joyride stops at Batista Loop for 10 minutes and Ghoom Station for 30 mins where you can visit the DHR Museum. 
It was worth every penny.",Jun-18
A Cute Experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,22-Jun-18,"Toy train in Darjeeling is one of the best attaraction, A small and cute train and memorable 2 hours of journey which you can feel all the time throughout your life while thinking of Darjeeling trip.. The feel will always be mesmerising..It starts from Darjeeling station take a 360 turn at Batasia Loop and stays at Ghoom station for 30 mins break and comes back to Darjeeling..Steam engine will cost 1300 per head and diesel engine will cost 850..Its better to book the ticket through IRCTC otherwise will run out of the tickets..",Jun-18
Birthday celebration,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-Jun-18,"My best friend and I have planned for our birthday at darjeeling. One of the most beautiful hill stations in India. During our stay we have visited darjeeling Himalayan railway which is a museum that explains about history of toy train in India. DHR is a world heritage site, certified by UNESCO. Must visit with your family.",Jun-18
"Dirty, expensive and not worthy.",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,19-Jun-18,We left the platform 1 hour later. We had paid for first class tickets and what we got was very similar to the regular tickets. The ride does not show amazing landscapes as it goes through the town and what you get to see is the jammed road. At one point I had to shut my window as I was getting dirty with the ashes. I wouldn't recommend it.,Jun-18
A Cherished Ride,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,17-Jun-18,"Travelled by the DHR .. Cherished the Ride .. It takes approximately 2hrs+ and traverses through the main road which is interesting to watch .. Advance Booking of tickets thru IRCTC or Travel Agent, Climate watch (no rain, haze etc) will guarantee a Blissful Experience.. Don't miss the museum at GHUM station.. !",May-18
"Heritage Experience, Exorbitantly Priced",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,15-Jun-18,"This narrow gauge Heritage Steam Engine ride, Darjeeling-Ghum-Darjeeling, is intended to relive a bygone era when this Railway Line was an engineering marvel. Booking tickets for this journey on IRCTC website is tricky- you need to enter Darjeeling DJ for From & Darjeeling DJRZ for To to get the Round ticket. Darjeeling Station is well-maintained. The Steam Engine is vintage & needs a Water-filling stop after 4kms of chugging ! There is a charming leisurely halt at Batasia Loop. At Ghum Station the Ghum Railway Museum has some interesting pictures & sundry Railway articles. The Railway Coaches with present-day seats lack a heritage feel. The thrill of riding the Railway train through the streets of Darjeeling, amidst vans, cars, two-wheelers, pedestrians etc is a new experience. Yet the 2-hour round trip feels stretched. And the fare of Rs.1310 is definitely Unfair. More",May-18
Northeast tour,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,11-Jun-18,"It's worth taking a ride in this world heritage toy . Even though the coaches require some upgradation.thevcharges are a bit high ?1310 for steam power and? 805 for diesel power ,still it's worth to take a ride upto ghoom. It takes about 2, hours.",Jun-18
Steam ahead,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,3-Jun-18,We took the steam train joyride for 2 hours return journey from Darjeeling Staion. The Seats were spacious and comfortable.

Lost the charm,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,2-Jun-18,"The train passes through crowded streets from Darjeeling to Ghoom, and has lost the charm that it once had several years ago.",May-18
Pleasant experience to ride this historical train,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,30-May-18,"Great place of tourist attraction. Toy train starts from here. Nice place to enjoy for the family. 
It might not be adventurous, but worth taking a ride to understand how difficult it is to build a train on these terrains. Kids will love this place & train ride.",Mar-18
Experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,28-May-18,I live here and I see them running everyday but I had never noon on one . I always wanted to experience one ride up to ghoom and I finally did it .. loved it. It was nice and slow ..the smoke loco went towards ghoom with whistling while I sat quietly and enjoyed my journey. A must do thing if you are in Darjeeling.,Mar-18
Ride through city,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,24-May-18,We went from Batasia loop to Ghum Station. It's a ride through the city. Nothing great but can view the town area.. Not very scenic,May-18
Experience the History,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,22-May-18,"This heritage train ride is the main attraction in Darjeeling. Getting the tickets was not as difficult as it seemed after surfing the net, you can simply walk up to the station and get your tickets. 

The best thing to do in Darjeeling is to take up this ride.",May-18
"horrible experience, pathetic service",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,22-May-18,"We had arrived at Darjeeling station on the morning of 8th May, all set to board a toy train to NJP, from where we had Kolkata's train to catch.To our utter disappointment and annoyance, the train which was supposed to depart at 8am ultimately left the station at 9:15am. All along, ten engineers were busy trying to figure out the glitch that had caused the delay, while passengers kept waiting forever.This is just the beginning and the rest was nothing short of a nightmare. Next, the train stopped at every single station and halted for about 30-45 mins at each stop, thanks to 'technical faults' that was rendering it immobile from time to time. As ridiculous as it may sound, the train completely stopped functioning at one of the stations after Kurseong and that was the limit.A family of five, we had to take a local bus to NJP as we did not want to miss the train. Mind you, not a single announcement was made informing passengers about the status of the journey all throughout the episode. When one pays INR 1300 approx for a ride, the mimimum that a tourist expects from the train is to reach the destination approximately close to the designated time. It's disgusting to see a railway that encashes its heritage status with such irresponsible service, completely regardless of the possibility that tourists may fail to reach home safely due to their callous negligence....

Memorable Train Journey,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,16-May-18,The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway line is definitely worthwhile to experience if one is visiting Darjeeling. One part of the line is from Darjeeling Station to Ghum (primarily for tourists) and the other part is from New Jalpaiguri to Darjeeling Station. We took the journey from Darjeeling to Kurseong and came back by a cab back to Darjeeling. One can book the tickets on irctc website and there is a first class coach also which in preferable.,Feb-18
What a way to travel...,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,15-May-18,"One of the cutest and most spectacular things you will do! Sure the only way to arrive in Darjeeling right? The full length of this narrow gauge service from NJP to Darjeeling is a long trip, some 7 hours. My wife and i completed this in both directions. In truth you will get the same views and sense of fun and history if you complete the steam 'joy ride' from Darjeeeling to Ghum and back in two hours. This includes a short stop at Ghum for the museum. 

I would recommend the joy ride if in Darjeeling. 

Tickets can be purchased online at the national indian railways site, you have to register first or in person at the station. Carriages are small and a little cramped and there is no refreshment service on board so take snacks if required. Food and drinks can be bought at Ghum and Darjeeling stations although the tea if bought only comes with lots of milk and sugar! More",Apr-18

What a beautiful experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,8-May-18,"Everyone visiting darjeeling should take this ride. Steam engine ride is something that our generation has not experienced much, well taking this ride will fill that gap. 

NOTE: book your tickets on line through IRCTC website couple of weeks before you arrive at darjeeling. Reach the station at least 15 mins before departure time. Keep in mind that darjeeling traffic jams can sometimes delay your trip 15-20 mins. So leave early.",May-18

Ride once before you die...,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,2-Apr-18,"My Toy train experience had been wonderful on my recent trip to Darjeeling. Riding this train would give you true sense of authentic steam engine experience and will make you think of British engineering of those days. 

However there are few things that I didn't like is their staff behaviour. They may be competent in their respective jobs but they are not really helpful in terms of giving you right directions in regards to buying a ticket or asking for a train timings. 

The management should raise the standard of professionalism and usage of technology slight more.This will allow the station more tourist friendly. At Least stations should have electronic notice board which would allow passengers to keep update about next train timings or any train cancellation. More",Mar-18
Great experience - Pure nostalgia!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,30-Mar-18,"Our Engine was called Whistle Queen, and did a brilliant job of getting us from Darjeeling to Ghoom and return. The amosphere is very special, with all the steam and the whistling from the engine. The narrow track is right in between the small stalls and the road, so you can look straight into people's shops, being it a carpenter, car mechanic or fruit & vegetable seller. There is a short stop at the Batasia Loop, next to a beautiful garden with a War Memorial to Gorkha soldiers. In Ghoom there is the opportunity to visit a railway museum whilst you wait for the train to return to Darjeeling. In Darjeeling railway station you can buy souvenirs, like mugs and postcards to remind you of this wonderful experience.

A comprehensive recount of the NJP to DJ toy train journey!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,22-Mar-18,"Being a "" railway enthusiast"" , the Darjeeling Himalayan railway was the last on my list of epic train journeys in India to be covered. Sadly , even after months of research , there wasn't enough literature available online on the trains running status. I'm sharing several things i learnt along my journey that should hopefully help a few more like me : 1. The NJP to DJ toy train is often confused with the Ghum to DJ joy ride train. These names are commonly juxtaposed during reviews. While the latter is a 1.5 hour train journey solely for the benefit of tourists, it is hauled usually by a steam loco ( check while booking ) , the former is a 7 hour journey , covering 88 km across 7 stations moving from a gradient of 130 m to 2050 m and hauled by a narrow gauge diesel engine. It has 2 first class coaches with bucket seats. The coaches now have small toilets. 2. The train is supposed to run daily between NJP and DJ and as per the local railway staff, it does. However this cannot be verified as the real time status of this train does not reflect online, thus you're forced to call up the station and be content with their Mono syllable responses. The day i travelled the train departed 4 hours late. The announcement was made 15 min after the scheduled departure which I...

While the latter is a 1.5 hour train journey solely for the benefit of tourists, it is hauled usually by a steam loco ( check while booking ) , the former is a 7 hour journey , covering 88 km across 7 stations moving from a gradient of 130 m to 2050 m and hauled by a narrow gauge diesel engine. It has 2 first class coaches with bucket seats. The coaches now have small toilets. 
2. The train is supposed to run daily between NJP and DJ and as per the local railway staff, it does. However this cannot be verified as the real time status of this train does not reflect online, thus you're forced to call up the station and be content with their Mono syllable responses. The day i travelled the train departed 4 hours late. The announcement was made 15 min after the scheduled departure which I found hilarious. To make matters worse, the infrastructure at NJP wasn't too great. No decent eateries and the narrow guage platform was completely deserted with the occasional drunks and pick pockets making their rounds. 
3. I was told that the train gets cancelled often due to landslides or poor patronage. So don't get disappointed if you get this message . But I would assume that it would happen during the monsoons or off season time. 
4. There is no official broad guage connection for this toy train and Yes, it could leave without waiting for the Howrah to NJP Darjeeling mail. Also remember that most trains in the north east run 2 hours late on an average, so be cautious and keep at least a 3 hour buffer. I reached siliguri the previous night just to be safe. 
5. There is no food provided anywhere during the 7 hour journey so be prepared with enough food and water. You might get a quick bite at kurseong. 
6. Secure your baggage and preferably shut the windows and doors till the train reaches sukna. The train travels very slowly through local settlements. On my journey, there were unruly teenagers hanging from the door trying to grab hold of anything possible. 
7. The journey was jumpy and the rake coupling wasn't great. It kinda takes a toll on you after 7 hours. The coach was not cleaned and the seats were caked with dust. While I understand this is a heritage railway network, the shimla and ooty journey was much more comfortable and better managed. The staff on duty weren't very professional. 
8. Do book transport and accomodation well before reaching DJ. In our case the train reached 4 hours late and the streets were deserted by 8 pm.. Not a single cab in sight. I understand hill towns shutting down early, its common, but a station being deserted by 8 pm was strange. 
9. You can book tickets for this train easily on the irctc site.. It available almost always during non season time. 

To summarize this journey probably wasn't all that was expected and the road is probably faster, cheaper and more comfortable. But the majestic himalayas did not disappoint. The scenery was splendid and the railway line was truly an engineering marvel. The loops and reverses are definitely unique to DHR. I loved the ghum railway museum and the bhatasia loop. While I wish this gift was better managed by the railways, I still have no regrets and enjoyed the journey ! More",Feb-18
Wastage of money,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,16-Mar-18,All city tour which is in a bad shape with no cleanliness. No viewing of hills during train tour. Tickets are very costly. No first class treatment given though it is mentioned on tickets.,Mar-18
Railway which passes through bazaars and markets,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,6-Mar-18,"Having traveled on other hill railways like Shimla and Ooty, this is the only railway which passes through bazaars and roads. It makes it interesting. The joy rides have been made expensive, still you can experience it by going to Ghoom in taxi or shared cab and take the 8.35 train to Darjeeling which is 30 minutes ride.",Mar-18
Charter tour to Darjeeling Himalyan Railway,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,3-Mar-18,We had an enjoybale few days using both our special charter steam hauled trains and also the Joy Train from Darjeeling to Glum. the museum at Glum has a lot of historic exhibits. Our visit to the locomtoive works was also fascinating. The staff are all friendly and helpful. Recommended.,Feb-18
A Ride to Remember !!!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,28-Feb-18,"The ""Joyride"" of 120 minutes in a well designed Toy Train which starts from Darjeeling station pulled by steam engine gives you a lifetime experience.As the train runs very slowly criss - crossing the roads one can see the beautiful panaromic view of "" The Queen of Hills "". On its way it stops at ""Batasia Loop"" where one experiences the breath- taking view of the hills.The ultimate destination is the Ghum station where the train stops for a longer duration so that the travellers can visit ""The Museum"" which is attached with the station where one can see as well as get to know about Darjeeling Himalayan Railway. 
As the train rolls back towards Darjeeling one can see peoples taking beautiful pictures of the train as it crosses. A railway assistant is present in each compartment Lastly,it is a memorable picturesque trip. More",Feb-18
Quaint little ?? train,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,12-Feb-18,"It's a quaint little running at very slow speed cris crossing the adjacent road as people stop and watch it go letting out a lot of smoke from its chimney. A good place to watch it is the Batasia Loop between Ghum and Darjeeling. 
The Darjeeling and Ghum stations are quaint little places with people walking by all over.",Feb-18
A steam hauled ride on the top of the world.,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,9-Feb-18,"Make sure that you book in advance so as not to miss out on one of the best railway trips in the world. Only 7 km is regularly hauled by steam, the rest by diesel but all of it is worth a trip. The ''Toy Train'' makes it's way along side the Hill Cart Road for much of the journey passing within inches of shop fronts and houses. The views are terrific. Winter is the best time to go.",Jan-18
Must see,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,8-Feb-18,"The steam engine train is simply out if the world.. Shouldn't miss. The best thing in darjeeling 
Amazing experience",Feb-18
Winter vacation.,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,6-Feb-18,"If someone is looking for a perfect family vacation, Darjeeling is the best for them. 
Best time-Winter season. 
How to reach- Fly from any corner of the world to Bagdogra(IXB) airport. Book a taxi which will take you directly to Darjeeling.",Dec-17
Darjeeling,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,28-Jan-18,It was a great experience to visit Darjeeling Himalayan railway. It runs on steam.the route of this train is very beautiful and picturesque,Oct-17
Part of History,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,22-Jan-18,"When I visited this place, It was an awesome experience. The place is a historical and interesting place.",Feb-17
UNESCO World Heritage site,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,17-Jan-18,"Felt awsome to travel in the means of transport of the yesteryears, One should experience this definately. The sound of the train was exciting and is the hallmark of the Darjeeling Himalayan railways.",Apr-17
Marvel,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,8-Jan-18,"Built in 1881, this mini train is marvel and one of four started by British. It runs from Siliguri to Darjeeling. Real feel of toy train. Ride exhilarates. Now popularised by many Hollywood and Bollywood movies.",Jan-18
Tracking kanchenjanga,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,4-Jan-18,Had a wonderful trip ...suitably called the joy ride from DHR to GHOOM. Loved it all the way long with a 10 mints break in batashia loop for clicking photographs and 25 mints break at the worlds highest altitude station GHOOM ..to visit the railway museum.Altogether had a nice experience.....,Dec-17
"Scenic, slow and cramped",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,3-Jan-18,Enjoyable for the scenic views but I wouldn’t recommend taking the route for longer than a 2 hour stretch. The carriages are small and cramped even in first class. Not worth paying for first class either as all carriages are of similar comfort.,Jan-18
Once in a lifetime 'must do' visit.,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,25-Dec-17,"This was a dream come true for a narrow gauge loving Brit from Cornwall like myself. Although the line from NJP to Kurseong is currently blocked by two landslides and u/s, the 'toy train' ride through the streets from Ghum to Darjeeling was simply fantastic, a step back in time to the days of the old steam hauled road trams a la Wantage Tramway. The staff were wonderful, inc the drivers, firemen and brakemen who all took time to chat and explain the daily workings of this fascinating line. 
Indian Railways need to step up their game, get the line restored asap, and get this line back in fully restored working condition urgently. It would be a huge crime if the line was allowed to slowly come to an undignified and painful close. 
Please see my photos: More",Dec-17
A step in to history,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,24-Dec-17,"1) This railway station is situated near town centre and still has the old station building maintained. As we walk inside, we feel like stepping in side railway history of India. 
2) This is a narrow-gauge railway which goes down towards Bagdogra/New Jalpaiguri. But we have a 2.5 hour return journey available which takes us from Darjeeling to Batasia Loop to Ghum Railway Museum and back. 
3) The tickets are expensive but it is worth for the memorable journey through Darjeeling streets where the train runs along with taxis, cars and pedestrians. It is a hilarious journey indeed. 
4) The Batasia Loop stop has a war memorial worth visiting and the Ghum Railway Museum houses many old photographs & equipment used during construction and use of the railway line in earlier days. Entry is free for these two spots when you travel on this journey. 
5) Overall it was an enjoyable journey and worth to have a peek at the history of Himalayan Railway. More",Apr-17
A Nature visit.,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,9-Dec-17,"Darjeeling is really a beautiful place to visit the natural beauty and peace. There are many places to visit in darjeeling like one of the most amazing is tiger hill, it is lovely to see in morning sunlight. Shopping is little bit expensive there, but although it is nice and beautiful to spend time with friends and family.",Jan-17
Quaint,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,24-Nov-17,Our group had mixed views on this. However i found it noisy very dirty inside the carriges and uncomfortable. If you go one way is more than enough. It’s not living up to its World Heritage inclusion at the moment.,Nov-17
Visiting is necessary but not necessary travelling,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,27-Oct-17,"According to me its little-overrated reviews people write. Its an amazing experience understanding how the engine functions which can happen at Darjeeling station as well. Talk to the driver rather than just sitting in the train for a ride. 
we have few prestigious UNESCO world heritage sites, which has thier own importance so I would suggest definitely go and visit but need not take a ride.",Apr-17
Visit,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Oct-17,Must visit. Dont go if height is a problem . Maintained. 4 persona can be accomodated at a time. Entry ticket is there.,Nov-16
Darjeeling Railway,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,21-Sep-17,Darjeeling Himalayan railway is very interesting and so very enjoyed ... When I go I am so very happy.,Sep-17
"The #Dreamliner :: A Joy ride to and fro Darjeeling stn to Ghoom stn is a MUST, when in Darjeeling",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,21-Sep-17,"The sweeet ""twoot, twoot"" of the toy train of 'DHR' ( Dz Himalayan Railways) will take ur breath away,even if you are not having a ride. 
Thee feelin' of a joyride from Dz to Ghoom stn and back, in the morning ( at around 900 to 930 hrs) will rejuvenate you the whole day ahead. 

There are Huge areas for improvement and augmentation of the toy train. 

The museum at Batasia loop is a major draw. 

For once at least, Enjoy the ride..... 'Zindegi Na Milegi Dobara' 

Cheers",May-17
Absolute must visit,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,31-Aug-17,"The rides are so amazing.The trains look like,it has stepped out of a fairy tale book.The children will absolutely will love it.",Jan-17
tiger hill and red panda,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,27-Jul-17,"tiger hill view is best view, and red panda is rear animal, the red Panda is almost as big as a reasonably sized domestic cat.",Nov-16
Toy train,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,16-Jul-17,So now dream chosen come true kids enjoyed a lot on toy train we clicked lots of photographs also when we reached ghum it was foggy very beautiful,Apr-17
Best ever plave to visit,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,16-Jul-17,Its best to visit Darjeeling as it is called a queen of hills the himalyan railway is the main attraction of the queen of hills its enjoyable to be inside the toy train of Darjeeling,Jan-17
Toy train,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,30-Jun-17,"Though considered a UNESCO world heritage site, the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, is not maintained well unfortunately. 
We had booked a joy ride in the train till Ghoom from Darjeeling. The train was 3 hrs late and there was no information about why it was late! It is only when the passengers started creating a scene that we were informed that the train coming back from Ghoom had got derailed and hence the delay! Well, if some announcements or information had been decimated to the harassed passengers, it would have been nice! 
The poorly maintained interiors of the Stan engine train also do not justify the high cost of the tickets! The seats are dirty and the windows are probably never cleaned, hampering clear views of the valley and peaks! 
It must have been a joy ride back in the days, when Darjeeling was a sleepy hilly town, unfortunately, no longer so! The city has got really crowded and the only clear views one enjoys are near the Batasia loop. 
However, it is worth a ride, just for the nostalgia! Be careful though, if you choose a steam engine, you may end up covered in soot and water drops by the end of your ride! More",May-17
One of the best attraction of Darjeeling,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,26-Jun-17,"DHR is one of the best attraction of Darjeeling. Its also called Toy Train. The train is run by Steam Engine. There are famous station in Darjeeling, Ghoom & Darjeeling. There are many different types of Joy Ride in this train. One have to book ticket online through IRCTC.",May-17
Back to old days of Steam engine experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,23-Jun-17,The steam Joyride is a must attraction in Darjelling...Don't book Diesel engine if u want to experience the old steam engine...the journey won't be as smooth as diesel one but that's the point to have a look back into steam engine...You would have certain difficulties as pointed out by other travellers but I think one should go for it..The ticket price is on higher side but it's costly to maintain old steam engine...so no regrets in paying high price..the only caution is don't take out your head or hand outside of train during journey especially if you are on right side of coach otherwise you might get hurt as the train at many places goes nearby to houses and rocks etc..Enjoy the steam ride of old times.... More,May-17
Great experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-Jun-17,It's a great opportunity to take a joy train ride on this UNESCO world heritage. Better to take the joy train ride which is a round ticket which goes to the Batisia loop which is unique and back,May-17
Chhuk Chhuk karti chalti rail,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Jun-17,"Darjeeling Himalayan Railways, The heritage railway gave us an best ever train memory of my life till now. Very nice train. Runs slow and very clean station.",Apr-17
"Overrated, soot filled and commercialized",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,13-Jun-17,"This used to be an experience to cherish and look forward to. Nowadays with the massive construction and concretization all around Darjeeling town, you no longer find the views from the toy train. The halts at Batasia loop and ghoom museum are the only worthy things. With a per head cost of 1300 INR, they don't even provide spacious seats with leg space. Avoid sitting on a window seat as the black soot particles from the steam engine will fall on your arms , clothes and hair.",Jun-17
Very Disappointing. Waste of Money,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,10-Jun-17,"I am still cursing myself for taking the decision of riding this so called joy ride toy train. First of all its very expensive, secondly you wont get any scenic views en route. All you can see is road and buildings. You will get some scenery, if you are sitting on one side of the train. You will get the same view, while coming back also, as this train does not take U turn for coming back, that means, the person sitting on other side, will not get any scenic views at all. 

The train runs on the same way of going to Tiger Hills. So, if you are Visiting Tiger hills, don't even bother to check out this train ride.The Most you can do is go to Darjeeling or Ghum station, take some pics in front of the train and come back. 

Not at all recommended More",Jun-17
Narrow Gage Adventure,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,9-Jun-17,"DHR Railway A world Haritage Site devloped & run by britisher. Rail track along with road. Reguler services for Darjeeling to Ghoom by diesel & steem engine respectively, for 2 times siliguri.",Apr-17
Enjoyable,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,6-Jun-17,This is in world Heritage site. This type of journey you can't get anywhere in the world . Presently due to landslide Siliguri to Darjeeling journey not possible but you can enjoy Darjeeling to Ghoom joy ride.,May-17
Experience the nostalgia.,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,3-Jun-17,"This one can make anyone nostalgic. The lovely steam engine, the childhood memories associated and the breath taking scenic beauty can be an add on.",May-17
Disappointing...,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,1-Jun-17,"We did not take the train, but followed its rails and saw it several times over 2 days and I must admit I was very disappointed. It seems quite polluting, it blocks some roads (and the traffic is already bad enough without it...), the rail from Darjeeling to Ghoom exactly follows the road, so there is no amazing view if you do only the short trip version. It seems expensive for what it is... I felt it looks much better in movies than in real life...",Apr-17
Cool and loud trip in the smoke!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,30-May-17,This was a fun trip up the mountain from Darjeeling to Ghum via the Batasia loop. The train station at Darjieeling is a bit confusing but once on the train the crew were helpful and though a little loud and smokey it was a wonderful trip with amazing sights off the mountains and a great little museum at the end in Ghum. Lots to see including an old steam train and the history of it being named as a UNESCO world heritage site,May-17

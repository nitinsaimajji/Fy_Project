Very well maintained and clean temple,ShwetaN131,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,14-Mar-19,"Birla Mandir is a holy place. You will get to worship types of Gods and goddess. It is a silent place. You need to store your footwears before entering the temple. After the worship you can roam around, you can sit outside the temple and spend the peaceful time.",Nov-18
Excellent temple but poorly maintained.,wanderer2174,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,8-Mar-19,"The Birla temple looks magnanimous when lit at night but our experience was disappointing. Starting from security staff which stand at the stairs down near the entrance asking for tips to the pundits who keep chanting Radhe Radhe especially also asking for tips !!! The temple has magnificent carvings and idols but the maintenance is very poorly.. maybe due to lack of funds / other reasons. 

Its good to see it from outside and its okay if you miss going in...",Feb-19
Want to spend some time on meditation ?,Pradip B,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,5-Mar-19,,
Impressive site,W0lf1e,"Montreal, Canada",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,27-Feb-19,This temple is a jewel. It’s like a mini-Akshardham that doesn’t look fake. It’s unfortunate that we are not allowed to take pictures in the area. Notice: be aware that cameras and bags are not permitted in the temple complex and there’s no cloak room for these objects.,Feb-19
Beautiful and Peaceful.,reubenranjanfern2017,"Noida, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,27-Feb-19,Very good architecture in this place. Very well maintained and clean. Interior is very good. Would recommend others.,Feb-19

a modern temple,smitagupta,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,22-Feb-19,"after the jostling crowds of the Kali Temple, i was pleasantly surprised to find the place quiet, clean with a soft soothing music playing in the background.Situated in the heart of the city, the place seems an oasis, with beautiful marble statues of all the Gods and goddesses.....",Jan-19
Beautiful temple to see the legacy of Birlas,sumitkasera,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,7-Feb-19,"The major business family of India including the Tatas and Birlas always had a rich tradition of doing lot of CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) activities. These families have created plethora of beautiful temple, hospitals, schools and other activities. The Birla mandir in Kolkata and in many other cities made are extension of this rich tradition. Wiki tells us that “A national chain of the ""Birla temples,"" temples of grandiose scale and design, have become major landmarks and part of the cityscapes of Indian urban life in the late twentieth century. The Birla temples exist in conjunction with other large industrial and philanthropic ventures of the wealthy Birla family, including major institutions of technology, medicine, and education.” Birla Mandir exists in many cities of India including Varanasi, Delhi, Kanpur, Kolkata, Jaipur and many other cities. These are typically made in white marble or sandstone. In Kolkata, it is easily reachable in Ballygunge area. Since we used Uber, was not sure about the parking. The temple opened in morning from 5.30 A.M. to 11 A.M and at 4.30pm in the evening till 9pm. We went in the evening and a small crowd gathered around. As soon as gates opened, it dissipated pretty soon. There was small room at the entrance that kept our shoes for a small fee as shoes were not allowed inside the main temple. The sanctum sanctorum was richly decorated, and temple was dedicated to Lord Krishna and Radha....

While there were no fees, the mesmerizing experience was mildly soured by constant demand for some money by the staff working there for the security and upkeep. 

For sure, the temple is a beautiful place to go and fall in awe for an hour to see the legacy of the Birlas. More",Jan-19
Is the story behind the Temple true?,rajarshi2016,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,28-Jan-19,"Impressive when you see it from outside, though does not look very grand once you view it from close quarters. However, what intrigued me was the story I heard from a friend of mine who knows the Birla family well. It seems that construction at the temple will never end, because apparently the Birla scion (GD Birla) who began constructing the temple in 1970 had a dream that the Birla business empire would collapse the day construction at this temple ended. Hence, there is always some work or the other in progress at the site. 

Worth a visit if you in the locality and have nothing better to do.",Jan-19

Want to spend some time on meditation ?,Pradip B,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-Dec-18,"Want to spend some time in serene atmosphere in Kolkata. Suggest go to Birla Temple. You may sit there for meditation also, as long as you want. 

The place is in the heart of Kolkata and easily approachable by public transport, Taxis and private vehicles. The temple structure is visible from a long distance",Feb-19

Fabulous Temple that Honour Krishna,ChenSuRen,"Singapore, Singapore",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,20-Nov-18,"Come and visit this temple in the morning when its not so crowded. Leave your shoes at the tiny shoe room at the corner before the main gate with some small donations. 
One important reminder, no cameras or mobile with cameras inside the premise, so you got to have someone to look after your device before you enter. 

All the murals inside are just fabulous ! Just find a corner and meditate to enjoy the peaceful ambience !",Feb-19

The Ganges splits into the Padma and the Hooghly in Murshidabad . We cannot dream the non-existence of this setu for a moment. Do you think the dedication of this engineering marvel to the mankind? Life will be standstill at a moment if anything happens to it. It is our habit, in our blood. Passing some moments standing on the bridge at one afternoon gazing at the southern sky to witness the sun set, is a memorable incidence in life. 
In the beginning in 1870, a pontoon bridge, also known as a floating bridge, generally floats or shallow boats are used for supports continuous deck for pedestrian & vehicle travel. It was converted to a Cantilever Bridge , namely New Howrah Bridge. The construction started in 1936 & completed in 1942 & was opened for public on 3rd February, 1943. Remarkably without any inauguration ceremony, that too out of fear to the British, lest Japanese war crafts attacked the bridge. It was 2nd world war period when Japan belonged to axis power & Britain in Allies power. 
It is learnt that 26500 tons of steel was used out of which 3000 tons was imported from England & the rest was supplied by Tata Steel & the company entrusted with the construction was The Braithwaite, Burn & Jessop Construction Co. 
As per census report as in 1946, the no of traffic was 27400 & pedestrian was more than 120000 per day .However, today the no of vehicles reaches more than 150000 & no of pedestrians is more than 2-3 lacs daily. It is very interesting that the 1st car moved on the bridge was a Tram Car on the opening day, ie, 03.02.1943. After 50 years ie on 03.02.1993, the movement of tram car on the bridge was permanently withdrawn to reduce pressure on the bridge.. 
Now let us walk down the memory lane of the history of the busiest bridge in the world, ie, Rabindra Setu , popularly called the Howrah Bridge. 
Calcutta became the capital of British India in 1772. 1911 British moved the capital of India from Calcutta to Delhi. 2001 Calcutta was officially renamed as 'Kolkata' 
By 1800 Calcutta had become a busy and flourishing town, the centre of the cultural as well as the political and economic life of Bengal. Hence gradually the importance of Calcutta was rapidly increasing. In view of the increasing traffic across the Hooghly River, a committee was appointed in 1855-56 to review alternatives for constructing a bridge across it.The old pontoon bridge was later replaced by the Howrah Bridge. The city underwent rapid industrial growth starting in the early 1850, especially in the textile and jute industries; this encouraged British company to massively invest in infrastructure projects, which included telegraph connections and Howrah railway station started operating in 1854. 
Wear & tear- Corrosion has been caused by bird droppings and human spitting. An investigation in 2003 revealed that as a result of prolonged chemical reaction caused by continuous collection of bird excreta, the bridge is also considerably damaged by pedestrians spitting out acidic, lime-mixed stimulants (gutka and paan 
I try to inform my fellow tourist that Howrah bridge was the 3rd , Forth Bridge in Scottland,UK (521mt, Largest from 1890 to 1917) & Pont De Quebec, Canada ( 549mt, largest from 1917 to present ) at the time of construction but its rank now is 6th as per length of Main Span. 

. Some interesting facts about this engineering wonder- 
> The bridge does not have nuts and bolts, but was formed by riveting the whole structure. 
> The government did not have a formal opening of the bridge due to fears of attacks by Japanese planes fighting the Allied Powers. 
> The first vehicle to use the bridge was a solitary tram. 
> From 1993 the tram services on the bridge were discontinued due to increasing load on the bridge. 
>31 May 2007 onwards, overloaded trucks were banned from plying on the bridge, and were redirected to the Vidyasagar Setu instead. The road is having the footpaths of width 15 feet, and they are used by the pedestrians. 
> The Kolkata Port Trust engaged contractors to regularly clean the bird droppings, at an annual expense of Rs.5.00 lacs. The authority painted bridge in 2014 with 26000 lit lead free aluminium colour paint. 
> Tata Steel supplied 23,000 tons of high tension steel. The Tatas developed the quality of steel required for the bridge and called it Tiscom. 
> The fabrication and erection work was awarded to a local engineering firm of Howrah: the Braithwaite, Burn & Jessop Construction Co. 
> The bridge is regarded ""the gateway to Kolkata, as it connects the city to the Howrah Station. 
> Culturally, The bridge has been shown in numerous film since 1953 like Do Bigha Zamin, Satyajit Ray's Parash Pathar in the same year, Howrah Bridge (1958), Mrinal Sen's 1972 National Award winning Bengali film Calcutta 71 , Richard Attenborough's 1982 Academy Award winning film Gandhi, Roland Joffé's English language film City of Joy in 1992 & so many films till date. 
> At the Kolkata end, the bridge ends right by colorful Mallick Ghat flower market, one of the city’s vast sources of flowers. The Strand Bank Road connects the Howrah Bridge at Kolkata’s end. 
> Howrah railway station is the oldest and the largest railway complex in India (1854), stands on the west bank. 
Observation of Platinum jubilee by KoPT in 2018- 
KoPT observed the attainment of” Howrah Bridge at 75” celebration with great pomp & light jointly by Tata Steel & Kolkata Port Trust. The future program they will take over, the illumination of the complete bridge with LED light & shed over the pedestrians path on both sides of Foot Bridge & a photo exhibition since the construction. 
Now the bridge is one of the elite club members like London Bridge & Sydney Harbor as an illuminated bridge. You just buy a ticket & board a launch to look at the lower portion of the bridge & to be wondered at the engineering skills.

I was really surprised at the fare for the airport transfer bus from Howrah station to Dum Dum Airport (Netaji Subash Chandra Bose Airport). It was only INR 45/- (less than a $1). These are AC buses and you need to walk out of the howrah station, cross over the road to reach the bus stand under howrah bridge. If you are carrying heavy luggage this option should be avoided.

like a living being it changes its show and ambience ion the different seasons, and all are worth viewing. if not possible , atleast visit it during the different hours of the day.. 
and do get the seperate views from the howrah end as well as the kolkata end, they are so much in contrast with the different skylines and the grossly different waterfront. 
if possible, take a boat/ferry ride on the ganges from the millenium park to howrah station and back,more if possible, during the sunset..This unveils the majesty of the bridge like nothing else. 
Also DO TAKE a trip in the morning to the adjoing flower market , and round it up with a quick breakfast of roadside chinese at the nearby terhitty bazar. 
but before you call it a day, do go back in the evening or early night,when this icon dresses up in coloured lights ,reflecting on the ganges, a beauty and bliss which few other human creations can offer. More",Jun-17

Amazingly HUGE. If HUGE is an understatement.,Sumit A,"Ghaziabad, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,6-Apr-17,"In today's times, when suspension bridges are small and their load bearing capacity is more, this bridge is exactly the opposite due to its ancient architecture. 

Why visit this place ? 

One of the architectural marvels of India. 
Also believed to be the first suspension bridge in India. 
When you walk or drive on this bridge, you become a part of this spectacle which Im short of words for. 

Why not to visit this place? 

If you don't care. Otherwise there's no reason to miss this bridge. 

USEFUL TIPS / HACKS: 

This bridge has restrictions on its load. Hence, barefoot people are not allowed on the bridge. However, if you wish to walk barefoot, look carefully at the both ends of the bridge alongside the running river. You'll notice people walking on the bridge on a foot path, you can only enter that footpath either on the starting of the bridge or the end as cars are not allowed to halt on the bridge. Simply, cross the road enter the footpath and there you go. Enjoy beautiful view at your own pace now. More",Jan-17

I found something which many travelers have not really mentioned in their reviews - about the traffic and climate, so thought to include that. 
Traveling towards Howrah Bridge is not always hassle free. Evening traffic is not something which anyone can avoid at all. During morning, the traffic is decent. 
Carry enough water and tissue papers as the climate of the city is very much humid and hot. The moment I stepped out of the flight, I could feel the sweat on my hand as well as all over. You have a decent crowd around and too much to eat and shop. Foodies and shopaholics should not get disappointed. 
A private cab will be a better option to avoid to waiting time and changing buses or autos. Food prices are nominal and not at all heavy on pocket.

"73 years old,still going strong!",padmaja111,"Hyderabad, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,25-May-16,"Howrah bridge is the icon of Kolkata, built 73 years back, still functional, carrying one lakh vehicles and one and half lakh pedestrians daily !To ease the load on it,Vidyasagar setu,Vivekananda setu and Nivedita setu are built across river Ganga/ Hoogly. 
It is a suspension and cantilever bridge(supported on one side only). 
It serves as gateway to Kolkota, connecting it to the Howrah station. 
The TATA company developed and supplied the kind of steel required for its construction. The construction cost was 25 million rupees at that time and it is the 6th longest bridge of its kind. 
But, it was damaged and repaired many times,now to clear the bird droppings ,annually 5 lakhs are spent. 
To protect the joints from corrosion due to human spitting, Kolkota port Authority, planned to cover the base of pillors with fibre glass casing. 
2 coats of painting required 26,500 lit of paint!!

Worth spending few minutes,Right_to_info,"Ahmedabad, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,23-Dec-15,"Although this bridge is always hustling and bustling with people and vehicles it offers a great site of the river Hubli (Ganga). One can spare few minutes to look at the architecture and construction quality, or one can just look at the ferries going between Howrah station towards Burra Bazar, or one can just look at the wide riverbed. On one side you reach a very busy Howrah train and bus station and on the other side you reach the wholesale market - Burra Bazar. 

I believe you are not allowed to take pictures, but it is not very strongly enforced. I have not taken any clicks but I could not find too many policemen on the bridge so there are chances that people make take clicks that would go unnoticed. 

It is easily reachable by public transport, but it is not worth spending too much time. 

I would also advice taking a boat ride on the river that starts from multiple locations that take you very close to the bridge on the river. The boat ride also has onboard live music and food you can buy. More",Dec-15

After the boatride we walked towards the bridge and along the banks there are lots of food stalls and benches to get a snack and relax, but you can also just walk and enjoy the environment, since the bank is quite well maintained.

The bridge is one of its kind and sixth longest bridge in the world. It is a lifeline of two cities Howrah and Calcutta. It also serves as a gateway to the city of Calcutta. The bridge has been renamed as Rabindra Setu in 1965. 

The bridge does not have nuts and bolts,but was formed by riveting the whole structure. It consumed 26,500 tons of steel, out of which 23,000 tons of high-tensile alloy steel, known as Tiscrom, were supplied by Tata Steel. 

Due to heavy traffic on the Rabindra Setu another bridge has been constructed over the river connecting the two cities named as Vidyasagar Setu also known as Second Hoogly Btidge at a distance. Vidyasagar Setu is the longest cable–stayed bridge in India and one of the longest in Asia. More",Sep-15

INTRODUCTION 
The Howrah Bridge, the fourth cantilever bridge in the world, was commissioned (under the aegis of the then commissioners of the Port of Calcutta) in February 1943. It consumed 26,500 tons of steel and was constructed at an approximate cost of Rs. 250 lakhs. No incidents of major casualty were reported during the construction phase of the bridge. 
RENAME 
Howrah Bridge (renamed as Rabindra Setu in the year 1965) after Rabindranath Tagore, the philosopher. 
HISTORY 
The end of the 17th Century Kolkata witnessed the gradual emergence of the city of Kolkata brought about by the merger of three villages - Kolkata, Sutanati & Gobindapur, on the eastern bank of the river Hooghly, the other name of River 'Ganga'. On the western bank, Howrah came up as a bustling site of commerce. 
The twin cities of Calcutta (re-named as Kolkata in the year 2001), and Howrah , were separated by the River Hooghly, and shared a common historical linkage towards the eventual construction of the Rabindra Setu, more commonly known as Howrah bridge. While Kolkata, from a small sleeping hamlet of artisans and mercantile community eventually developed , as a commercial hub of a modern metropolitan city , Howrah (virtually the store house of raw material resources) became its industrial satellite. 
Kolkata was declared the capital of India by the British and remained so till 1911. The railway station at Howrah set up in the year 1906 and the bridge (later popularly known as Howrah Bridge) thus served as the logistic link with the country's one of the oldest metropolis, Kolkata. The Legislative department of the then Government of Bengal passed the Howrah Bridge Act, in the year 1871, under the Bengal Act IX of 1871. 
For the convenient plying of passenger and vehicular traffic, the pool was connected as a whole. However, this was unfastened everyday, particularly during the night for safe passage of steamers, boats and other marine vehicles. From 19th August, 1879, the bridge was illuminated by fixing electric poles at the centre.This was done by using the electricity rendered from the dynamo at the Mallick GhatPumping Station. The Bridge was then 1528 ft. long and 62 ft. wide. On both sideswere pavements 7 ft. wide for the sake of pedestrians. The 48 ft. road in between,was for plying of traffic.

It was pretty crowded and we couldn't stop as the cabbie had only agrred to a round trip. But its a good piece of engineering and it was lit up so that was pretty.

But I am not sure it is worth a trip by itself as a sight to see. 

Of course it does cross the Ganges, so that was a thought I enjoyed each time we entered the bridge, and on the Howrah side, you see the enormous railway station which is also a somewhat beautiful building. 

Given that Kolkata doesn't have a lot of special sights to see, I guess the Howrah bridge is not a waste of time if you have the time and wish to experience more of Kolkata. Just don't expect too much. More",Feb-15

Best Glimpses on Mother Ganges,CUnow,Switzerland,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,27-Jan-15,"I have been to Kolkata many times, but not often at the shore of the Ganga within the city, so driving over the Howrah bridge, which connects the twin cities of Howrah and Kolkata, was the only opportunity to get a glimpse of the Ganga within the metro area. I remember how much I liked to see the river each time crossing that way. 

The fact that it is called Howrah Bridge and not Kolkata Bridge points to the reality that it is seen as the pathway for Kolkatans over to Howrah, where the main railway station is situated. Since everyone has to go there some time or other, the Howrah Bridge is the point of convergence of so much traffic, and a nice one at that, since you get to see there all forms of conveyance all at the same time, including pedestrians also. 

What makes Kolkata beautiful is her people. The Bengalis are among the nicest, most remarkable people in all of India. But Kolkata is also full of migrants from Bihar and other states. The Howrah Bridge is that special place which most of us use, most likely by crossing it with a taxi, without really fully knowing the full significance of it. More",Feb-14

Massive crowd passing, lots of vehicles travelling, but everybody in an unruly behaviour. People spats betel all over the places, vehicles with huge dark fumes passing, dusty, everything ridiculous.

It connects the city of Howrah to Calcutta. It has another famous name as 'Rabindra Setu'. It was set up in 1874. There are two 270 feet high pillars on which the bridge stands. It is cantilever truss bridge constructed without using any nuts and bolts. Earlier there was a tram route but now what we see here is a Road Bridge. It has two more bridges namely, Vidyasagar Setu and the Vivekananda Setu, which are located at different points over the Hoogli river. This bridge is an important spot which no one whoever visits Kolkata will miss to see. The daily traffic is said to be more than a lakh vehicles and innumerable pedestrians. I wanted to walk along but for want of time I have postponed that venture. This bridge is compared to the other world famous suspension bridge Sydney Harbour Bridge. But by no stretch of imagination Sydney can dream of such numerous traffic as in Howrah.

As on now there are eight-lane Bridge carrying a constant flow of more than a lakh vehicles and 2 million commuters every day. The ferries running... Howrah Bridge is one of the wonderful bridges in the world built across the river Hoogli in West Bengal in India, which is considered to be the busiest bridge on this globe. It connects the city of Howrah to Calcutta. It has another famous name as 'Rabindra Setu'. It was set up in 1874. There are two 270 feet high pillars on which the bridge stands. It is cantilever truss bridge constructed without using any nuts and bolts. Earlier there was a tram route but now what we see here is a Road Bridge. It has two more bridges namely, Vidyasagar Setu and the Vivekananda Setu, which are located at different points over the Hoogli river. This bridge is an important spot which no one whoever visits Kolkata will miss to see. 

The daily traffic is said to be more than a lakh vehicles and innumerable pedestrians. I wanted to walk along but for want of time I have postponed that venture. This bridge is compared to the other world famous suspension bridge Sydney Harbour Bridge. But by no stretch of imagination Sydney can dream of such numerous traffic as in Howrah. It appears to be very fine when you look it from the midst of the river from where photography is strictly prohibited. 

As on now there are eight-lane Bridge carrying a constant flow of more than a lakh vehicles and 2 million commuters every day. The ferries running from below Howrah Station are a more convenient to cross the river and it gives the best view of the bridge. 

The Howrah Railway Station is one of the largest in the world with rail connections to all major cities and towns in the country. It is important terminus for the suburban railway services of the Eastern and the South Eastern Railway. From Howrah Bridge we may also visit the Millennium Park, Eden Garden, Bara Bazar, and BBD Bagh to make the trip memorable. 

Reaching Kolkata is neither cumbersome nor of any difficult thing or adventure. This Metropolitan city is well connected by Air, Train and road. Plenty of accommodations varieties of food are available in abundance. More",May-14

Incredible Engineering,StephenW1513,"Melbourne, Australia",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,8-Nov-14,"The bridge isn't all that interesting as you drive or walk over it, and there aren't many good photo angles from the side walks anyway. You're not supposed to take photographs, so it's a relief really that you're not missing anything. 

However, pass onto the East side of the bridge and walk into the flower markets, staying as far right (close to the river) as possible. There's a little temple, full of homeless people, that leads out onto a small ghat. 

The ghat stinks, but the view of the bridge from it is stunning. Only from here can you can see how the bridge just floats above the river, suspended from a clever balanced cantilever arrangement. I've uploaded a black and white photo that I took from there, labeled as one taken from the ghat you get to from the flower market. 

The bridge is an amazing feat of engineering, well worth checking out, and it's only about 100 rupees in a cab from Sudder Street, if you can get them to ignore your white skin and run the meter! More",

The Howrah Bridge, is a cantilever bridge with a suspended span over the Hooghly River in Kolkata, West Bengal, India. It was commissioned in 1943, the bridge was originally named the New Howrah Bridge, because it replaced a pontoon bridge at the same location linking the two cities of Howrah and Kolkata (Calcutta). 

It was renamed as Rabindra Setu, on 14 June 1965, after the great Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore, who was the first Indian and Asian to bag the Nobel Prize.. However people still call it as ""Howrah Bridge"" as it is popular known by this name only. 

Heavy Traffic flows on the bridge since it connects Howrah and Kolkata,.carrying a daily traffic of approximately 100,000 vehicles and possibly more than 150,000 pedestrians, and easily making it the busiest cantilever bridge in the world. The third-longest cantilever bridge at the time of its construction, the Howrah Bridge is the sixth-longest bridge of its type in the world.

-26500 metric tons of steel. Almost 2.6 times more of the total weight of Eiffel Tower. 
-Its a bridge which does not have a support in middle and only has support at the two ends. Extreme engineering of a suspension bridge. 
-World's busiest cantilever suspension bridge with a daily traffic of over 100000 vehicles and 400000 pedestrians. 
-It is currently 6th longest bridge of its type in the world. 
-It has no nuts and bolts. Has just rivets. Heated, hammered and cooled to fit.

Walking on the bridge that carries all the traffic to the two sides of river Hoogly, Kolkata on the eastern side and Howrah district on the western side, is a great experience. 

Best view of the bridge is at night when it is beautifully lit and can be viewed from much distance. Especially enchanting is the view moving on the boats on the bed of the river Hoogly.

Majestic as part of Kolkata's tradition of crowding and transportation,TimothyScanlon,"Washington, District of Columbia, United States",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,5-Jan-13,"Kolkata is known, if for nothing else, for her crowding and for her railway stations. Sealdah is a wonder of pre-modern humantity. But Howrah is a close second. to get to the Howrah station, though, you must pass over the incredible Howrah Bridge. To get there, you'll most likely pass through Barabazar (probably spelled wrong) which I'll try to review later. 

The bridge itself is an engineering wonder. I'm not an engineer, so my comparison is probably not apt, but it reminds me of the Eifel Tower: bars made up of more bars, made up of still smaller bars, crowing the Hoogly River from Calcutta to Howrah. You'll be moving slowly to and over the bridge. So if you're impatient of claustrophobic, avoid it like the proverbial plague. But if you're as fascinated by the dilemma of overpopulation as I am, don't miss it!

Crossing this bridge are vehicles of all types and pedestrians; vendors sit on the side with their wares. 
At times the vehicular traffic gets jammed and the waiting period for the next movement can take pretty long, but presently the traffic movement as eased considerably with the construction of the second Howrah Bridge. More",Jan-12

Rudyard Kipling mentioned the bridge in City of Dreadful Night: ""Why, this is London! This is the docks. This is Imperial. This is worth coming across India to see!"" The Howrah Bridge is not quite a tourist attraction but a great necessity for the people here. Constructed in 1943 it was the 3rd largest cantilever bridge in the world and is the 6th largest today. The bridge is used by an estimated 100,000+ vehicles and over 150,000 pedestrians making it the busiest bridge in the world. The structure is maintained by the Kolkata Port Trust but the maintenance work of such a busy structure is a daunting task. Hence one could say they are doing a good job of it but perhaps a toll system could provide necessary funding to beautify and maintain the bridge better. More",Dec-11

Today a part of Howrah is a hub of industrial development; while the suburbs remain steeped in agrarian activities. Thus Howrah has been able to maintain its natural scenic views and allure tourists coming to West Bengal. Verdant paddy fields, fast flowing rivers and picturesque sunsets, Howrah is more than heritage and history. Proximity to Kolkata helps the tourists stay in Howrah and enjoy the slower paced lifestyle while enjoying true hospitality and lip smacking cuisine. Innumerable accommodations ranging from luxury hotels to small guesthouses are available all through the year. 
Belur Math, Northern part of Howrah (about 4 km from Howrah railway station. You can travel there by bus, auto or taxi. It takes 20-25 mins to get there and around 40 mins to return, because this route is longer and becomes more congested. All modes of transportation are easily accessible from adjacent to the Howrah railway station area/Howrah bus stand. Local trains also go th Belur Math, but going by auto, bus or taxi is much better as they drop you off at the entrance of Belur Math.). It's a worthwhile visit. Situated next to the Ganges one can sit on the banks of the river Hoogly during evening time and relax. Across the river Hoogly is the Dakhineshwar Temple. A visit to the temple is free and so is parking.. edit 

By travelling with the ""Howrah - Belur Math"" local train to Belur Math you might catch a glimpse of the oldest operating Railway workshop in India built in 1853. 

Botanical Garden, (situated in the Southern part of Howrah, about 3km from Howrah station, get there by bus or taxi - depending on traffic it will take you anything between 25-45 minutes). Mar-Sept: 5am-5.30pm; Oct-Feb: 5.30am-5pm. A extraordinary place of vivid nature under the smog filled sky of the city. You will value the silence that is only filled by some birds singing. Nature is wonderfully beautiful here foreigners: Rs.50; Indians: Rs.5. edit 

Santragachhi Jheel, Middle part of Howrah city (7 km from howrah station by train, or 6 km from kolkata via Vidyasagar Setu). Santragachhi Jheel is a large lake, located next to the Santragachhi railway station. This lake attracts large number of migratory birds in the winter months, particularly in December and January. The number has increased in recent years, as migratory birds have started to avoid destinations like the lakes in Alipore Zoo, Kolkata. Birds like Saras Crane from North America and Australia, and many other local migratory birds such as Cotton Pygmy Goose, Comb Duck etc. are spotted here during this season. The lake area is owned by South Eastern Railway, though the Forest Department of West Bengal also looks after the place. Efforts are made by local residents, Forest Department and Railways to improve the environment for the birds. Forest Ministry of the State Government of West Bengal intends to convert the lake to a 'wildlife conservation centre More",Jul-11

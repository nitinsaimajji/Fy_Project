Go only if you love garden,Pooja_Vikesh,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,22-Jan-19,So reaching at this place is a big task in itself. Cause of hilly roads and narrow path this place is a bit risky . You will have to climb so those who can’t walk enough should avoid going. After reaching here you will have great view though.,Jan-19
An exceptiona garden to see,Expedition18005,"Howrah District, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,17-Jan-19,"It is a must see whenever any one is in Darjeeling. Very well maintained. But you need time and control your speed to see this garden, After all worth to spend time here.",Dec-18
A terrible one in my entire trip,Atandra P,Kolkata,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,14-Jan-19,The Roads are pathetic and not even maintained with bare minimum level as you enter from Dalli. Very accident Prone Road. The park is also not in a good shape as I have visited for more than 10times in last 20 years. The park is not maintained at all and very dirty place. it can easily be avoided while visiting darjeeling to save time and energy. A pathetic one travellers need to avoid this as roads are very very poor and accident prone.,Jan-19
A Super Natural Green Garden,skhanppsd,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,13-Jan-19,"The Rock Garden also known as Barbotey Rock Garden is located some 10 km (or 6.2 miles) away from Darjeeling town in a valley down below. However the view of Darjeeling’s landscape and the mountain range from the road is unparalleled. At Rock Garden there is a wonderful waterfall that comes all the way from the top and over the rocks to down below. You will need to keep climbing stairs, go up the ramp and cross small bridges across the rocks to reach up to the top. However, there are beautiful flower gardens, trees and shrubbery at all levels along with nice seating arrangements. So you can take rest and relax, enjoy the views around as you go up. 
These lovely places are known for their cascading waterfalls, lush green scenery and innumerable species of beautiful flowers and ornamental plants– that are bound to take your breath away. 
Visitors should make arrangement for transportation to this place. You can take photographs of surrounding beautiful areas as many as you can. More",Nov-18
Visit at Barbotey Rock Garden,malay1944,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,8-Jan-19,"The Rock garden at Chunnu Summer Falls and Ganga Maya Park or Barbotey Garden are recently added as a tourist attraction in the hilly town of Darjeeling, West Bengal, India. It is located at a distance of 10 km from Darjeeling town in a valley down below. the gradient of the road is very steep with nos of hairpin bends. The photography is popular at this scenic hangout of waterfalls with flowers and rocks. It may be difficult for the elderly people to move around the flower garden due to height.",Dec-18
Rock Garden,AMITAVAB67,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,23-Dec-18,A paradise for Nature lovers. A lot of steps to climb though not at all exhausting. Found a lot of wild orchids and indulged in bird watching.,Dec-18
"Very eco-friendly, no plastics allowed inside, even water bottles.",davissmg2,"Port Elizabeth, South Africa",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,20-Dec-18,"The plants are well kept, there are no plastic rubbish around, which is very commendable. The waterfall makes a soothing and beautiful noise to make you realize the presence of nature. 
The Gorkhas provided an opportunity to be clothed in traditional Gorkha clothes to be photographed, for children aas well as for adults. The ladies were adorned with the beaded headdress, wrap-around apron and snug-fitting top, with a brightly painted water urn to carry, and the men were fierce-looking in their Gorkha pants and top with a large dangerous-looking Gorkha sable! An experience not to miss!",Nov-18
NIce place to visit....need more maintenance,Tarek K,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,9-Dec-18,"A bit distance from main city & roads are too bad. But the place is beautiful with a long going waterfall. A long walking trail where you can enjoy big rocks, waterfall, lots of flowers and nature. Try not to litter as place is already bit dirty.",Nov-18
Places of interest near Darjeeling,bindapersad,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,25-Nov-18,An amazing display of natural rock art. Well laid gardens. Roads to garden is very very bumpy. Drivers are amazing with their skills and knowledge of various routes to and from garden. Dept of Tourism need to do a study of roads to all places of interest .,Oct-18
Just to pass the time,Anshumanafsa,"Kurseong, India, Asia",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,1-Nov-18,Ok. You are a tourist. Made plans to stay in Darjeeling town for a week. After 2 days you find you have nothing to occupy your mind. So you get on the tourist trail and visit this place. About 3to 4000feet below Darjeeling. It would have been nice if this place was left without any man made structures. But the blatant monstrosity of the artificial walkways and the giant concrete lotus is nauseating.,Sep-18
Good Garden,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,18-Oct-18,This is a very good place to visit in Darjeeling.There are many types of flowers tree.In this garden water fall is also very good.,Oct-18

A beautiful park with beautiful arts,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,28-Aug-18,This is far away from the city and this park was very crowded. But we spent some beautiful memories and time in this park. Here park was clean.,Jun-18
Disgusting,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,26-Jul-18,There is nothing great in the garden. The garden is not at all maintained. The approach road is really bad. Darjeeling has many better places this is definitely not one of them and can be given a miss. I wouldn't suggest anyone to visit this place as the place is not worth the bumpy ride that takes you to rock garden.,Jan-18
Awesome view,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Jul-18,It's nice to visit the Barbotey Rock Garden in Darjeeling. Awesome view and relaxing place. I would love to visit again.,Jul-18

Wonderful! The best experience of my trip.,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,17-Jun-18,"My friend and I had an entire day left to ourselves after visiting all the other tourist attraction spots in the town. We had to take a call between 'the Rock Garden' and 'the Lloyd's Botanical Garden'. We decided to be a little adventurous and picked the Rock Garden as our destination. As we were on a tight budget and didn't want to hire a car for visiting just a single tourist spot, we decided to walk it. It was approximately a 6.5 km walk from our hotel in the middle of Darjeeling to the Rock Garden. It was a cloudy day with slight chances of drizzles. We left the hotel after breakfast at around 9 am. The first 3 kms of our walk was via the Hill Cart Road. At a point near the Dali Monastery, a feeder road went down towards the valley where there was an altitude drop of 2500 feet in the span of 3.6 km loopy, winding road. The valley is where the Rock Garden is situated. With the help of Google Maps, navigating our way through was very simple. Our plan was to reach the Garden by 11 am, spend an hour there and start our hike back at 12. Since it would be an uphill hike, we expected to return for lunch by 3 pm.

Our plan was to reach the Garden by 11 am, spend an hour there and start our hike back at 12. Since it would be an uphill hike, we expected to return for lunch by 3 pm. 

The walk was long, a little tiring but absolutely wonderful. As we slowly descended down the hillside the misty view of the valley and the hilltops looked like a painting. The tea plantations were beautiful. We came across the Orange Valley Tea Estate. Oh! what a visual treat it was! There were women plucking tea leaves and lovely, cool breeze blowing by. We stuck to the road mainly and took shortcuts by walking through tea plantations at times. It was an experience like never before. On reaching the Rock Garden, the waterfall rejuvenated us. We roamed around for sometime. There were a few roadside shops selling momos, maggis, fruit juices and even breezers. After taking a few snaps and selfies with the waterfall and feasting on momos, we stuffed our backpacks with fruit juices for re-hydrating on our way back. The way back was a bit more tiring with the sun peeping through the clouds and the upward slope. However, it still was a very fascinating hike and we made it back to our hotel well in time. 

For everyone who loves a long walk and for all youngsters with the passion for trekking and adventure, I'd strongly suggest you to walk it. I'm telling you, you won't regret it and it'll be a memorable experience. The scenic beauty around will enchant you. The Rock Garden itself is a lovely place. The waterfall makes it special. Please, please, please go for it. You'll love it! More",May-18
damaged,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,14-Jun-18,"This garden bears the brunt of every uproar and Hadthal in the region. Its just waste of time to wade thru' the traffic , getting stuck in the jam..sitting the cab for hours to witness this.",May-18
a large dirty drain,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,12-Jun-18,"very poorly maintained, very dirty,approach road very bad. there is nothing worth seeing. do not visit this place.",Jun-18
Good,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,2-Jun-18,I enjoyed the place alot. Very good for family. Best place in Darjeeling. Must visit to all. There is a very good view of water falls.,Jun-18
Nothing Spectacular!!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,24-May-18,Its not worth driving about 10 kms away to see this garden.The garden is actually located in a valley and we did enjoy the drive but the garden was quite a disappointment!!,Mar-18
world class beauty,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-May-18,"if you not seeing this place you miss the whole trip 
one of the most beautiful place in Darjeeling 
how can people create a natural place this kind of tourist place you can not believe either seeing this",Nov-17
Not spectacular,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,20-May-18,Rock Garden & Ganga Maya Park - These are just two separate parks. There are nothing to see except artificial structure and dirt.,Jun-17
Well worth the visit,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,15-May-18,"It was a wet, gloomy day and we were initially reluctant to step out. However the drive to that place was wonderful - we could see the tea estates around us, with tea pickers, and the winding road down. The garden itself has a waterfall as its main attraction with paths to hike up around the fall and bridges criss-crossing the water. The children ages 8,10,12 had a great time and we were glad we didn't let the weather keep us in.",May-18
Good place to visit,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,14-May-18,"The road to the rock garden takes you downward from Darjeeling in the valley and through many tea gardens. We visited it on 30th April and it was raining and foggy however when we reached the rock garden we were surprised to see a waterfall there. 

Then we came to know that the waterfall was just not because it was raining, but it is there year round. it is a nice place where there are walkways created near the waterfall along with small bridges where people can click photos. Just where you get in there are small cafes where you can get maggi and some snacks. 

Overall it is a good place where you can spend some time. More",Apr-18
Nice scenic beauty,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,7-May-18,The nature around this garden is very nice. The sound of the waterfall in the quiet nature makes the garden perfect. best time to visit this place is March-April month.,Mar-18

Excellent views around a waterfall,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,28-Apr-18,"Venue offers excellent views around a waterfall; in the middle of mountains from all sides; there is a river in the middle and sloping hills on one side which has a waterfall in it, with pathways and stairs constructed around the waterfall. Worth a visit.",Apr-18
Beautiful Rock Garden,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,26-Apr-18,The rock garden is actually located in the Ganga Maya Park. It has been naturally landscaped along with the contours of the hill around the waterfalls located in the park. A must place to visit in Darjeeling.,Feb-18
Great,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,8-Apr-18,"A great place to visit. Natural and man made waterfalls and segmented areas make this place a must-visit for photography-lovers. Only accessible by car, this place takes around 20 minutes from town centre to reach. No entry fee. Ample tea stalls outside.",Mar-18
Awesome Place,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,27-Mar-18,"This spot in a must to visit place in Darjeeling. This place is full of natural beauty. The main attraction is water fall and view from the top of the place. Not only this, you will find the way to Rock Garden itself very beautiful. You will find there many small food stall to enjoy Momos, Tea, Noodles etc.",Mar-18
Stone with beauty,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,22-Mar-18,Flowers and fountains. It's a bit run down but good place to visit. Need extra breath to walk around the park. It's beautiful.,Feb-18
Waterfalls and View point,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,19-Mar-18,The rock garden is built surrounding a waterfall slightly deep down the valley of the city of Darjeeling. The drive is risky and scenic at the same time covered with tea plantations throughout. There are also a couple of tea estate on the way.,Mar-18
Excellent place for photo shoots.,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Mar-18,Excellent place and rich in scenic views. One must visit for photo shoots and see greenery and water falls. Distance is of 2 hours drive from Darjeeling city one way. People usually spend two - three hours over here.,Mar-18
Beautiful visiting place in Darjrrling!!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,11-Mar-18,"We have visited this place in February. The place has been created by beautifully desiging a rock. You have to climb a good number of stairs to reach to the top but the view from the top is awesome. This place provides a good play area for the kids. However this place requires somr maintenance, as the garden is not properly maintained.",Mar-18
Nice place with a good effort to maintain,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,5-Mar-18,"This place has been built with some sense, and I liked the overall architecture, not for people who dont like to climb stairs, if you have the ability to climb a 100 stairs then go for it else, take pictures standing down at the bottom.",Mar-18
Good place,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,27-Feb-18,"Good place to visit while you are in Darjeeling. A small water fall is there, great place to visit for kids specially.",Apr-17
"Kids would love the park, a small water fall and the winds roads up the hill",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,31-Jan-18,"Long and winding drive to the garden. 
If kids are there in the group, sure they would love the visit, for adults not so recommended. 
A bit more maintenance is required at the infrastructure, One would see that the maintenance staff would be in full swing on brooming and chipping of the extra twigs but the place could receive a facelift and can become a major tourist attraction.",Jan-18
Attractive waterfalls,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,30-Jan-18,Barbotey Rock Garden is situated below a Tea Garden. The main attraction is the waterfalls. The rock structures and animal figures are very lovely to watch. Small kids will love this place very much. Good place to hang out with family.,Oct-17
Lovely visit,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,23-Jan-18,"This is the one of the best place in Darjeeling for nature lovers, it is in the valley and the view of the falls are best for photography.",Dec-17

"Beautiful, picnic spot",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,10-Oct-17,"The rock garden is built around a natural waterfall, and has multiple levels. Beautiful flower garden dot the path around the waterfall.",Jun-17
A great scope to be something Marvelous,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,21-Aug-17,It's a lovely place without any doubt. It can and surely be enhanced as it has a lot of possibility in it. Currently its only a path around a water stream and some people may not like it. But the sheer location and the free feel of roaming around the water stream has loads of charm. A little creativity and this place can turn out to be a great place to hang out for everyone. But then with great location comes great responsibility. Mind it !,Sep-16
Concrete!!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,6-Jul-17,This is nothing but a pathway constructed around a water stream. A small artificial lake having boating option but it's not really a place one enjoys who expects some natural scenic beauty. Good for couples to do boating etc but compared to other places in Darjeeling this is not up to the mark. Please visit only if you have nothing else to do.,Apr-17
Good place for a picnic,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,27-Jun-17,"This place is 9-10 km. from Darjeeling - the road branches off near Ghum and goes into a steep descent past the beautiful Orange Valley Tea Estate (where the customary photographs are clicked by tourists). There is a waterfall coming from right up and beyond the entrance (chargeable), one has to walk onto a steep concrete pathway past flowers, shrubs and other such landscaping. Along the way at various levels are benches and bridges where you can move to the other side of the waterfall. It would be tiring for elderly persons to go to the highest point hence depending on the fitness level, a person should decide to what level he/she should go. It would be nice to simply sit and relax on one of the benches listening to the waterfall cascade. A portion of the garden plus some eating places and toilets are on the other side of the road also. Families with kids can easily enjoy a couple of hours at the spot. There are some food joints on the main road also but I cannot comment on the same as I did not have anything there. One main drawback is there is no public transport not even share-a-seat vehicle so one has to hire a vehicle for this garden plus Ganga Maya Park, 3-4 km. further down. More",Apr-17
A nice place to visit with children,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,5-Jun-17,"It is commonly call Rock Garden and is situated below a Tea Garden. The rock structures, animal figures and the main attraction the Waterfall. Overall and lovely little package where you can spend three to four hours easily and the kids will love it. The drive from Darjeeling to this place is also worth the money. If you are looking for something out of the world you can give it a miss.",May-17
Good Place for half a day tour..,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,1-Jun-17,Rock garden is one of the attractions in and around Darjeeling. Takes an ahour from Darjeeling by taxi. The artificially created waterfalls and rock landscapes are beautiful. woth half a days visit.,Oct-16
Very Beautiful picnic spot,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,26-May-17,"Little distant place compared to other tourist spots of Darjeeling, but it is worth going there. The garden is developed vertically along a cascading falls. Very pleasant atmosphere and one can trek and spend some leisure time with his friends and family.",May-17
A garden with waterfall,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,26-May-17,"Darjeeling is a place which always memorize you with its beauty and surrounding. This garden is none of a exception. With a beautiful waterfall just in the middle of the garden is all that u need to spend a quality time with ur loved and dear ones. The garden is full of beautiful flowers, pine trees beautiful insects, birds etc. The waterfall is the main attraction of this place. There are pavements and bridges from which u can climb up the waterfall. This garden is little far way from the main town, in the lap of a forest. A mysterious silence resides in this area where the parknis situated. The sound of the flowing water and the singing of the birds ceates an amazing environment. The only downfall of this park is, it lacks cleanliness and transport facility. No public transport is available to this place from the main town. One have to reserve a car to reach this garden. But for its beauty its just not at all create any problem as it is a must visit palce in Darjeeling. More",May-17
"The gorgeous landscape of waterfalls, fountains, bridges, rocks, etc",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,26-May-17,"The Rock Garden (also known as Barbotey Rock Garden) at Chunnu Summer Falls is recently added tourist attractions in the hilly town of Darjeeling in the state of West Bengal, India.

Females can also get dressed in the local dress and take pictures. It looks very beautiful on rainy days. Entry fees are RS 10/-. More",Apr-17
An ordinary place,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,24-May-17,"If you have nothing to do in Darjeeling , you might think of visiting the place. The place might be more attractive during monsoon. I found the place to be quite dirty and not to my loking. There is no decent place to eat . Food is available in the roadside which does not look clean and healthy.",May-17
Just a waterfall,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,20-May-17,"There is nothing great about the place at all. Basically people have cashed on a natural feature. There is absolutely no infrastructure to speak of. Local taxi drivers fleece unsuspecting tourists pitching in for this place which has got absolutely nothing. 

Lot of crowd, and the water in the lower levels is very unclean with lot of garbage thrown in. The views require climbing up which is not feasible for kids or elderly. 

Total waste of time and money (the entry fee is negligible but the cabs charge a bomb for wasting your time). Can be dangerous and slippery in the rains.",Mar-17
Trip to Darjeeling & Gangtok,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,18-May-17,Way to Rock Garden is very stiff mountain road. But amazing view of tea gardens & Himalayan mountain range. Well maintained but need to visit when not raining or after raining.,May-17
Horribly Beautiful,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,14-May-17,Though it is a beautiful place to visit but Don't ever visit this place when it is raining. Water comes out in monsterous way.,May-17
Family trip,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,5-May-17,The rock garden is a good family destination in a place away from Darjeeling. This is a good family trip but not very convenient on a rainy day which we experienced. There are lot of sitting options for elderly people.,Jul-16
A beautiful spot,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,4-May-17,"The ride to the Rock Garden is interesting as the road leaves the main center of Darjeeling, passes through tea fields, and twists down hairpin turns. The Rock Garden features waterfalls that cascade down a steep canyon and tumble carelessly over boulders. The flowers were in full bloom, and added to the intensity of our pictures.",Apr-17
Peaceful garden,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,29-Apr-17,"Awesome rock garden, we were really enjoy there. Very nice water falls. Well decorated and well maintained this park. Many statue lives there and also available many bench for sitting there. Here are you expend sometime with your family, friends. But there was not any good washroom. Only one pay and use toilet stay here but that is very dirty and bad smell. Some food shop available here. Like chicken or veg momos, Maggie, tea etc. Good place for enjoy your vacation.",Apr-17
Not so great,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,15-Apr-17,This Rock Garden used to be much better a decade back. But now it is more of a concrete element with quite a few eateries scattered here and there amidst the garden. Nontheless one can always have a delicious plate of piping hot maggii surrounded by greenary around and flowing water below.,May-16
A Park with a differce,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,14-Apr-17,"LOCATION: About 10km from Darjeeling town. Approached through good roads. Like all outskirts places, this too has only ""Momo and Maggie"" joints and no good restaurants around. 

PARK: Its laid on hilly terrain. Landscape is designed quite well using steep Contours and water stream very well creating the kaleidoscope of water bodies, vegetation and rocks. Yet walk around is not at all tiresome as the same is provided with many terraces to sit and chat around. Water fall is quite scenic and approachable for those who want to enjoy water. 

COULD be BETTER: No Public wash rooms. At one corner a private pay and use wash room but was quite dirty. The road divided the Park in literally 2 parts. Some internal connection could establish the continuity. No directional signage. 

Overall, a reasonably well maintained and clean premise. Usually not included in general list of itinerary yet one must make a point to visit. More",Apr-17
Beautiful garden,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,14-Apr-17,"At a distance of 17 km from Darjeeling town nestled among hills this is a garden which looks surreal. 

There are plenty of trees with white and peach colored flowers adorning the place. Rivulets flowing over undulated land and boulders and culverts created for uninterrupted flow. Small bridges that runs over these rivulets will carry you from one side to another. 

A large water-body is present in the park where you can do some boating. This is a large expanse of land and you can easily spend an hour by soaking in the nature.",Mar-17
A cement lotus,Anshumanafsa,"Kurseong, India, Asia",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,7-Apr-17,Sometimes people loose their imagination and then you end up with a structure like this. There are so many wonderful gardens to be inspired from while building a garden.,Apr-17

Rock garden is picturesque from top of the waterfalls.,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,10-Mar-17,"The Barbotey Rock Garden, popularly known as the Rock Garden at the Chunnu Summer Falls is located about 10 Km from Darjeeling. It has been cut and made from rock. A Big Lotus , made of rock , surrounded by a beautiful lake is situated here.

Not a great place anymore. Can be skipped.,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,12-Feb-17,It's quote unclean and not very well maintained.

Historically Significant,Philip P,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,16-Nov-16,"Built by Bishop Daniel Wilson, the Cathedral Church of St.Paul's is worthwhile to visit for a glimpse of colonial history.

The church was a part of the Anglican Church until 1970 when after church union it became a part of the Church of North India. 
The plaques on the wall are a strong reminder of the colonial presence in India with several plaques speaking of the colonial version of events in 1857. 
However the church was also involved deeply with Bangladeshi refugees who came in droves in the period around 1971 and the church also is testimony to this legacy.

It resembles typical Hindu temples that have its walls adorned with different commemorative plaques. But some of the wall embellishments truly date back to old times and give a glimpse of the history. It celebrates sacrifices made by the British in India. The glass paintings are beautiful. The wooden pews look impressive and so does the pulpit. The architecture is typical Anglican. The building is however decaying.

The negative is that no electronic devices are allowed inside the Cathedral.

It is certainly a place of peace and piety but the interior is reminiscent of a simpler time and a simpler type of ecclesiastical architecture and decoration. 
All that being said a visit here is perhaps a good time to reflect on the disparities of the city without, the obvious wealth and the very visible poverty is perhaps best reflected in this rather austere edifice. 
The walls bear testament to some of the great, the good and the not so good from Calcutta's past but one especially caught my eye. This was a tribute set into a wall for two men whose ashes were far from the cathedral but at no known location, at least on the wall of the cathedral their lives have been noted.

For those who seek peace, a place to pray to christ of course this is a place to go to, but for those who are sightseeing I wouldn't reserve too much time for it and just take it along when you go and see the victoria memorial because they are walking distance from each other. 

If you go and see it, just reserve 15 minutes that is really all you need and remember that inside no pictures are allowed (which i can imagine in a place of worship). More",Sep-15

It is within walking distance from Victoria Memorial and the Birla Planetarium. The exterior of the cathedral is currently in partial renovation, but it's still easy to enjoy the striking architecture. Inside, you feel as if you've walked back in time - the horrid honking of the streets disappears, and you're walking through the dark, stone rooms in almost perfect silence. We were lucky enough to be visiting while the choir was practicing, and their melodious voices added such a wonderful sense of peace and majesty to our visit.",Dec-14

It is the first Episcopal church in the whole of india,Pakistan, sri lanka,Bangladesh and Burma. It was built in the model of a cathedral in England and after the spire and other parts were destroyed by earthquakes it was rebuilt in the Canterbury model. It is an island of tranquility amidst the madness of Kolkata. On the downside it has become very touristy and hardly a place of worship. I have known a house of God being closed for three hours in the afternoon. If you are on park street you can take a cab or walk .",May-14
India's St. Paul's,HarjitG,"Chicago, Illinois",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-May-14,"Eventhough this is not THE St. Paul's Cathedral renowned across the world, the cathedral in Kolkata is still worth a visit. The white facade of the building in the heart of the city, surrounded by beautiful tended gardens is still lovely to visit after nearly two hundred years of it's original build.

Not much of a cathedral,Arjun S,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,14-May-14,A quiet and peaceful place. Euphemistic for empty and barren especially compared to the Victoria memorial across the road.

A peaceful haven,Peter S,"Canberra, Australia",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,30-Jan-14,"St Paul's Cathedral is a haven in the chaos of central Kolkata. It testifies to the presence of Christianity in modern Kolkata, as well as the importance of Bengal's British military and civil community over the past 150-odd years. It was designed in whitewashed Gothic Revival style by a British engineer of the Bengal Army (who is commemorated at the back of the church) and its high ceilings, and fans demonstrate the sense of his design. The cathedral's walls are covered in memorials to various military and civil figures which are often evocative and even moving. Sadly, the cathedrals caretakers discourage photography - for reasons that aren't clear - but determined surreptitious photography is possible. Unfortunately you can no longer buy a cup of tea in the nearby hall, but a visit is highly recommended. More",Jan-14
See It After the Victoria Monument,camsean,"Chengdu, China",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,27-Jan-14,"This cathedral is not, for me, one of the city's greatest sights, but it is certainly worth stopping by if you are in the vicinity. The solid colonial architecture is another reminder of how important a centre this was in the British Empire. Its spires can still be spotted from quite far away today. It remains an important religious centre for Indian Catholics, but the curious tourist is not made to feel unwelcome either. It is set in a peaceful yard which is a respite from the hubbub outside. 

If you are hungry, there are a number of kati roll stalls outside. These Kolkata specialties are very tasty and make for a good snack between sights. More",Jan-14

Still, the individual panels were wonderful. Although this is their prime objet d'art, they don't really seem to think so. The lower range was half hidden by an ill-placed conference table and chairs on a sort of mezzanine over the porch of the cathedral.

Wonderful art and architecture.,astroaadil,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Dec-12,The Church of North India's St. Paul's Cathedral in Kolkata is a wonderful place to visit for the art and architecture besides the marble and other memorials to soldiers and other people who have died in the olden times since around 1814.

If you happen to be in Kolkata during the christmas time. Then a mid night mass on Christmas eve is a ""Must do"". Inside the church ,candles are lit up during the mass which looks so beautiful. If you want to be a part of this experience then I suggest that you find a place inside the church at least 2 hrs before the service or else , the doors to the church will be locked since the crowd becomes too large to handle.

They took us to this cathedral. While it wasn't atypical as far as cathedrals go, the best part was that we arrived as some children were having choir practice inside. We got to hear them sing within the cathedral and it was glorious. Highly recommend seeing some kind of service or, as we did, some singing.

a surprise with some great history here,davekv,"Las Vegas, Nevada",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,23-Feb-09,"St Paul’s church turned out to be a nice surprise. Located exactly next door to the Planetarium, architecturally it is only fair to average. The outside needs a good cleaning and some paint and the inside does as well. There is a beautiful stained glass window above the central nave which is worth a look. 

But, the real attractions are the memorials in the rear of the church. The memorials commemorate the passing of various church members and often give a good account of how they met their end. Dating back to the early 1800’s, you read stories of wars and rebellions and epidemics and typhoons and exotic explorations into unchartered lands. The memorials are a fascinating account of unvarnished history. You can see just how the church was a center of life for the British during their years of governance. A fantastic place with the memorials making St Paul’s, in my opinion, a “must see” in Kolkata. More",

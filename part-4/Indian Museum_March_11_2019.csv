Average,Vainamo,Finland,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,13-Feb-19,"Animals are probably the best part, otherwise the collections are either very minimal (e.g. Egypt room) or then totally huge and meaningless unless you are some super enthusiast of that discipline (e.g. the stone collections with hundreds of similar boring rock collections). Also the building is badly outdated (as the entire city...). So do not expect anything like the Brittish museum or any other big western national museum. Not a bad idea to spend a couple of hours, but do not expect too much.",Dec-18

Beautiful Ancient Indian Art,NikaJunie,"Jersey City, New Jersey",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,7-Feb-19,"The Indian Museum occupies an indifferently maintained, but beautiful, heritage building on a vibrant street of sidewalk peddlers and small shops. We arrived early in the morning while one of the cleaners was removing the pigeon droppings that accumulated over the course of the previous day as birds fly in and out of the galleries. This gives the place a tolerant, Buddhist vib. It was founded in 1814, the first general museum in India, Asia, and the Pacific rim. It houses some wonderful works of art including Jain, Buddhist, and Hindu stone sculpture and Indo-Persian miniature paintings beautifully conserved and framed. There is an excellent, large coin collection presented with almost no context. Display is very old-fashioned and signage (in Bengali, Hindi, and English) is minimal. We skipped the natural history displays. Expect some galleries to be closed. Admission is charged (higher for foreigners than for Indians). For a virtual tour, see the museum’s website. More",Feb-19

Oasis of calm and history,KTS_trip,UK,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,11-Dec-18,"the way items are displayed is simple. Some more information on some exhibits would have been useful. That said it's lovely to get a feel for some of the history of India away from the buildings and temples, The arches around the green open space provide some cool and shade. 
Not overwhelmed by people it's easy to lose a few hours here just meandering around the different galleries. It helps put Kolkata and India's history into perspective from the old bones/fossils/trees to the coinage.",Nov-18
Indian museum :- some tips,sudeeppandey,"Kanpur, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,11-Dec-18,"Few important tips to visit 
1. You can put your luggage under the security if it is not too big at specific location adjacent to entrance. They kept my back pack and a trolley bag with out any cost.

Address: 27, Jawaharlal Nehru Road, Park Street, Kolkata. 
Founded in 1814. Every single gallery is amazing. My personal favorites were the Bharhut remains of a 2000 year old stupa railing; the Gandhara sculptures, Archaeology, the botanical collection (begun in 1901 with over 15,000 specimens from the Botanical Survey of India on display), the mask collection, coins, and geology, but that is only half of it. Worth staying an extra day in Kolkata, not to be missed.",Nov-18

A Walk Through the Pre-history,doibedouin,"Howrah, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Nov-18,"Hopping through a museum is like figuratively going back in time and visiting the prehistoric era. It is like moving in reverse, to the Palaeolithic eons, to human discovering fire, however with the same innate inquisitiveness and thrill. The reminiscence of visiting a new place is always relishing and when it comes to visiting a museum, the dormant primal strings of our genes unprecedentedly gets stimulated.",Aug-18
What a good show !,Ian G,"Durham, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,21-Nov-18,"Liked everything about this museum, presentation was excellent and such a variety on show although the taxidermy needed looking at in the large mammal section",Nov-18

A nice place for one day trip in the city of joy,Saheli P,India,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,6-Nov-18,"Indian Museum of Kolkata is perfect place for the explorers. 
It includes huge ranges of historical to geological to cultural items collections. Some of them are really very rare. 
But my favourite one is the collection of Egyptian Mummy in the rightest corner of 1st floor in the Museum. The room contains all necessary information about Egyptian culture. 
In the middle of the 1st floor we can see huge collection of Indian Paintings by some master painters which include the painting of R.N Tagore, Abanindranath Tagore, Nandalal Bose, Jamini Roy ...the list is quite long..In the left of this room we will find Mughal Miniature Painting, Pahari Painting and painting from other different schools. 
In the right hand side of Ground Floor there is a huge collection of Buddha's and other deities sculpture from different periods across the world which we shouldn't miss at any cost. 
In the left hand side there is a exhibition on Human Revolution. 
Another interesting fact about the Indian Museum is their vast skeleton collection of different animals including dinosaur, mammoth, blue whale and many more. 
It can be a very useful educational tour for the students of Geology cause of their huge collection of rocks and salt.

Not for tourists...,mguay1958,"Toronto, Canada",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,30-Oct-18,"Disappointing visit. Nice building. Steep price of entry for foreigners (500 rs)... 25X price for locals. Not sure where the money goes as it seems no money has been spent in upgrades and maintenance in 75 years.

Run-down but surprisingly captivating,Sophie B,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,17-Oct-18,"Honestly I went here with low expectations, knowing that my 4 and 5 year old boys have limited patience for museums. However, the impressive architecture and wide range of exhibits kept them captivated for well over an hour. The museum is cheap for Indian nationals but expensive (rs 500) for foreigners. Thankfully the kids got in free. Many of the exhibits seem untouched since early last century, but the decrepit, musty air kind of adds to the charm! Kids loved the huge gallery of taxidermied animals and the Egyptian mummy.",Jul-18
Fun for kids,aastha_pro,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,17-Oct-18,It is one of the ideal place to visit on a winter afternoon. Kids will surely enjoy this place. It has a very good collection and some very rare items. It is very interesting and a must visit. The ticket price is 20 INR.,Jun-18

Uninspiring Venue,blackpoolsteve2015,"Blackpool, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,21-Sep-18,"I visited the museum to get out of the heavy rain. Sadly, it is very dated,and it has not changed much in the last 70 years. 
The exibits are old and I was charged 500 rupees,(about £5), whilst locals can get in for 20 rupees (20p); - which is nearer the mark. 
For this p[rice, I would expect a map and guide book, but these were not available. 
I understand that this is supposed to be one of the best in India? The Pitt Rivers Museum is Oxford is far superior, and free.

Good place to visit for young and old.,Sherpa816069,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,17-Sep-18,"The largest and the oldest museum in India, this place charms the young and the old alike. There is no better place to get the kids started with history. The Egypt section is particularly exciting and the mummy is rare and unique. If lucky, you can also experience programs conducted in its premises (apart from the huge collection that the museum boasts of).

"Ok, but if you are not Indian it will be 500 rupees",Becky F,"Omaha, Nebraska",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,15-Sep-18,Spent a few hours here. It is a good way to spend a few hours looking at artifacts and fossils. The best part are the stone carvings and the whale skeleton.,Sep-18

Sometimes you need a smaller boat,JennLewDC,"Annandale, Virginia",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,30-Aug-18,"I had looked forward to seeing this museum for a long time. But was sadly disappointed. Most amazing building given to house the collections. But allowed to dilapidate considerably. Far too big with just not much to display. Fossil rooms are very old and built only for the interest of those who work on these. This should be a crown museum. India is one of the most fantastic countries on the planet. This place needs some major fund raising and PR and then total rehaul of exhibits. It could still be a crown. I think if the right folks get involved and start getting Indians with cash to contribute and the govt to also contribute, it could easily be the hottest destination in Kolkata. More",Aug-18

Somewhat disappointing but some nice art,teresateklic,Germany,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,7-Aug-18,"Considering that the Indian Museum in Kolkata is the largest and oldest in India, our expectations were not really met. If you compare it to other countries' museums of that rank, it seems a bit provincial. We basically skipped all the natural science sections (geology, animal evolution etc.) because they were poorly done. The archaeology section, however, exhibiting a range of Indian sculptures across the ages, was decent, so was the section on Indian coinage and an exhibit by a contemporary Indian artist (from 2018). Generally there is a lack of information on the exhibits. We liked the art gallery best - it has a lot of very beautiful Indian paintings and old books. Base line: Apart from the art gallery, not really worth the 500 INR they charge for foreigners. More",Aug-18
One of the best in India,Nilraja,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,4-Aug-18,Indian Museum in Kolkata is one of the best museum in this country. It has got every thing.

"Huge, Brilliant...Devoid of Tech though",NirmalSunkari,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,30-Jul-18,"The Museum is brilliant simply cause it has a numerical advantage. Sculpture after sculpture, collection after collection, never cease to amaze you. The Patna museum and Gaya museum will probably have half of what is on display here. The collection of ancient coins is simply superb. 

And therein lies the museum's weakness. It has these in such abundance, that the carelessness and neglect is plainly visible. The museum also lacks any hearing aids or A/C or any other amenities expected of a museum its size",Jun-18

As you enter the museum, you walk into the ancient India gallery where the exhibits can be touched by any visitor, transferring all the oil from their hands. There is no air conditioning, hardly any explanation about the importance of background of the exhibited piece. There is no audio visual component to explain the period of history. There are no self guided tour pamphlets for visitors. My children had no idea about most of the exhibits and we had to Google most of it while standing there.

An oddly mixed experience.,fromagebleu,"Sydney, Australia",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,21-May-18,"A grand old building that's in need of some love. Some of the exhibits don't seem to have been touched for a century - the taxidermied birds were covered in dust so all appeared to be a uniform shade of sludge, even the parrots. The fish were even worse, depressed looking specimens bearing little resemblance to their real life counterparts. The whale exhibit was closed so we left hoping it had fared better. 
A highlight was an exhibition of the most exquisite miniature paintings which were worth the visit alone. We also loved the textile gallery, again worth the entry fee. 
The odd contrast between the galleries gives this museum a whimsical character so it's definitely worth checking out. More",Apr-18

Had various collections , rather say treasures from the past. Informative and good. Enjoyed the visit. Excellent building . However i was able to notice following things such as cleanliness is totally neglected in the premises. The stairs were full of dirt and droppings of birds and unclean. Also inside the museum the unwanted and dismantled items are not cleared from the exhibit area giving an awkward and unpleasant look. Also foul smell is present in few place.Also ventilation is poor in most of the areas which will definitely causes sweating for the visitors.The stairs were too high which will be difficult for aged people to climb.

Big treat for me as a museum goer. The ancient coins exhibition has really nicely arranged information about the exhibition. The information displayed for sculptures and paintings can be improved. 
Besides Indian arts, they also have a Egyptian exhibition, which I decided to skip due to my limited time. 
This museum also has a several exhibition on natural history. Some spicemen of animal fossil are quite impressive, but the exhibition was poorly organized: too many things stuff together without any information.

Slowly being dragged into the 21st Century but it has a long way to go,TargaTripper,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,20-Mar-18,"Had a free afternoon during my recent visit to Kolkata and visited with my sister. There is a two tier fee system - foreigners pay extra which means the museum is more accessible to the Iocals and more money can be spent on more improvements. No bags are allowed in the museum so we checked then in at the entrance and were given a fob. Was a bit worried about this as I forgot to take out my purse but got our bags and purse back safely at the end. We then had to go through a security check before entering the impressive entrance which had corridors and stairs leading off to the different exhibits. You can see that efforts are being made to drag the museum up to western standards, a lot of work has already been done but more still needs doing. The displays of stone carvings, wood carvings, paintings, arts and crafts, coin collections, fauna and birds all look quite new and are well labelled with lots of information. We enjoyed looking at all the Indian culture and learning. However the rooms with the fossils and the animal skeletons really need an overhaul but you can understand why these have been left until last to rennovate. There are just so many display cases with bits of bones and fossils, where to start? Yes they are probably important but to the casual visitor it was just fossil overload....

We visited during the week of the religous festival of Holi and the museum was fairly busy so we waited until we had finished to visit the canteen and get a drink as we had unthinkingly left our bottles of water in our bags. The entrance leading to the canteen looked like a dingy back alley and when we got there it was shut. (About 2.30pm) Apparently it only serves food, no tea or coffee with a slice of cake. There was a drinking fountain of sorts (waterpipe coming out of a wall) but nothing to indicate if it was safe for drinking. Couldn't see any signs for toilets either. Lots of steps but no ramps or elevators so not suitable for anyone with mobility issues. There is a small kiosk off the main entrance which sells a few souvenirs. 

The museum has the potential to become a world class museum and is a treaure trove of Indian culture but needs to keep up it's programme of improvements and offer more for the needs of its visitors. We enjoyed our visit but the lack of basic amenities really let it down. More",Feb-18

This seems to be a popular outing for local families on a Sunday afternoon. There is an extensive collection of Buddhist pieces that was the draw for me.

I think there is some major refurbishment going on as many of the rooms were shut. Sadly, these were all the things we were most interested in, like the insect room (which when it opens looks like it will be as good if not better than the insect exhibits in the NHM in London). We were really disappointed that the insects weren't open as it looks like a great exhibit. The fossil invertebrates collection is huge but doesn't have that much information about what you're seeing. The Egypt exhibition was quite interesting, albeit very small. Some other galleries, e.g. ancient history and some other zoology exhibits I think, were shut too. The shop didn't have much in and the café was also shut. So what was there was OK but I felt like we only saw half the museum really.

Buy sadly the museum does not live up to your expectations, especially when you have kids with you. 

There is nothing on Indian history at all. No armouries, no artefacts. The sections that were interesting were Coins, Egypt and Fossils. Also the fossils are stored more keeping research scholars in mind, if you are interested find it, they are not on proper display. 

My feeling is the museum is not display friendly at all, it's more for serious students and not casual visitors like us. I have seen quite a few museums in India, but this one is not uptomark.

Given winter time, lot of people were visiting the place. It will take an entire day to cover all the areas. 
Overall cleanliness is bad, saw one of the security guy spitting pan inside the building. There is restrooms on ground floor but again not very clean. There is a grass lawn inside, you can sit under the sun there.

A Visit to the Indian Museum in Kolkata,sudipdasin,"Calcutta, West Bengal, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,24-Dec-17,"The oldest and largest Museum in India is Indian Museum in Kolkata, near Park Street Metro Station. It has rare collections of antiques, arms, armors, coins, statues, masks, fossils, arts, stuffed animals, tombs and so much more from India, Asia and other parts of the World. The building itself reminds us of British legacy with a splendid architecture and a fabulous landscaped park right inside the building. 

Though the presentation of the artefacts is not anywhere near spectacular, the artefacts really are. From rocks and fossils, to art to memorabilia it has just about everything for people to enjoy. It takes a couple of hours to see all that it has to offer, so plan your trip carefully. 

To me the visit to Indian Museum was informative, educative and historically nourishing which is going to linger in my mind for a long time. More",Aug-17

But the part which was the highlight was the Mummy which is expected to be more then 4000 years old. The authorities should try and make the place a little lively with different type of lighting and the placement of the manifestations. They should also employ guides for better understanding of the artifacts or promote audio tours offering multilingual option in the audio devices. hat way it can attract more foreign tourists from different linguistics backgrounds. Also, should they put up a Do's and Don't's list and include ""Please maintain Silence"" in the Do's list. Some people who are genuinely interested in the artifacts and trying to read the contents of the exhibits are distressed by the clamorous chatter of other groups or individuals.

Should take at least 45 minutes to see all the rooms. (Mammals exhibit closed for refurbishing.) Very interested visitors (whether in the South Asian sculptures, pairings, coins, or rocks & fossils) can take many more hours give the large number of items on display.

Why to visit this place ? 

To see Mummies kept in Egypt Section. 
If you wish to check off the Indian Museum from your list. 
If you've heard it's bad but you want to see that from your eyes to believe that. 

Why not to visit this place ? 

Every single exhibit showcases none piece of information. I came across a footprint of Gautam Buddha which not even mentioned whether that is an imprint or a real one and nobody from the entire museum knew anything about it. How disappointing ? 

USEFUL TIPS / HACKS : 

First, visit Egypt section to see Mummified bodies along with egyptian remains. 
Do not go to Rocks section, unless you study them. You'll save ample time. 
Next, visit Human Evolution section. Which has very nice exhibits including time chart, dna and human body evolution.

It has six sections comprising thirty five galleries of cultural and scientific artifacts namely Art, Archaeology, Anthropology, Geology, Zoology and Economic Botany. 
The Indian Museum originated from the Asiatic Society of Bengal which was created by Sir William Jones in 1784. The concept of having a museum arose in 1796 from members of the Asiatic Society as a place where man-made and natural objects could be collected, cared for and displayed. The objective began to look achievable in 1808 when the Society was offered suitable accommodation by the Government of India in the Chowringhee-Park Street area.

A peep into the ancient culture through the old sculptures, coins and art pieces was quite educative too. 

While quite a few sections were closed for renovation, of those open, The Birds and Fish section seemed to be recently redone and was interesting. 

During our visit we could also take a quick peek into an exhibition demonstrating evolution of Nagas.

The museum itself is divided into different sections like archeology, zoology,geology, art, etc... Out of these my favorite was archeology and zoology. The archeology section has even some fossils of dinosors and mammoths( not sure if they are original), while the zoology section showcases different animals and birds and their natural habitats. Then there is a Egyptian gallery were a mummified body is displayed. 

The things which I did not like are 

The cleanliness of the museum is not up to the mark. 

There is a lot of pegions flying around on the walkways. Care should be taken or else there is a good chance that they will s**t on you. 

The stairs to the first floor is a little steep. I saw many old people struggle on stairs. 

As a whole it's a good place to visit both with friends and with family. There is also a small area in the centre where you can enjoy chatting in groups. It would be great place to visit with kids. More",Jan-17

I love museums and I have been to quite a few but I think this museum would benefit from everyone admitting that it's boring and the reason kids don't think history is fun. It is currently under heavy reconstruction- probably hindered due to it still being open. 

Do not go here you will walk slowly around a large ACHIVE, not, a museum that is meant for scientific research. It is not a museum to look at things or find out more it's a place that's expensive and really really BORING.

"Indian Museum, Kolkata- where History becomes alive",Piyessir,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,1-Nov-16,"The Indian Museum , located conveniently on Chowringhee Road, a few meters down south of Grand Hotel on the same footpath should be a must-see for visitors to Kolkata. At one time this was one of the largest museum in British rule outside England. It is an excellent repository of the the varied art and craft culture of India through the centuries. More discerning visitors could mark the different examples of the beautiful stone carvings belonging to the 12th to 15th centuries.For lovers of wild life, there are many exhibits of the fauna especially of India, Himalayan antelope, Nilgiri Thar to more common wild animals.Spanning over several galleries, a stroll through the entire museum can test your stamina, but the effort should be rewarding enough.

Reeks of negligence,ChinmayHota,"Bhubaneswar, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,25-Oct-16,"My two star rating is for the poor upkeep of an eminent institution of the country that has a hollowed history of 202 years. My rating has nothing to do with the precious collection, which will rank as one of the best in the world. Many of the displayed items are covered by dust, cobwebs, and showcased in an untidy manner. The priceless ancient statues displayed on the corridor near the architecture section are left in the open, and the identification boards are destroyed by the elements. One can imagine what kind of damage natural forces must be making to the archaeological items there. 

Having said that I must repeat once again that the collection of items is something to feel proud of. There are Egyptian mummies on display. The miniature painting section showcases the best of ancient and medieval Indian art. Bengal art section is complete with Abanindra Nath, Nadalal, Jamini Roy and others. The collection of ancient gold and silver coins is unique. Display in the geological section is comprehensive covering rocks from all parts of India and also from few other countries. 

Many talks and events are held in the Museum precincts to commemorate special occasions. There is a gift shop at the back of the museum selling books, statues and memorabilia at very reasonable prices. There is also a canteen at the back of the gift shop where all kinds of Indian food are available. More",Oct-16

"Decent for Indian standards, a little underwhelming otherwise",peterpudaite,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,18-Oct-16,"Despite India's rich and diverse history, we just don't seem to be able to show this off. 

The Indian Museum is set in an old colonial building with a courtyard in the middle. Having two young kids, they loved running around the wide hall ways and the green in the middle. 

The museum itself has a wide range of collections covering geology, zoology, culture, architecture and more. Unlike a lot of museums the displays are relatively well maintained but it's obvious nothing has been updated since the first installation. There's plenty to see at the museum and you could easily spend a whole day there. However with very little information about each display they don't hold interest especially casual or young audience. 

It's worth going for a visit at least once. More",Apr-16

If you are inquisitive, I would suggest spare atleast half a day for this place. We could spare only less, and was left longing for more. No guide available at all. But the exhibits are given proper written explanations. 

One who care must venture to read and digest the information. But the writings are reasonably lucid and usable. 

Starting from paleontological finds from around India to Contemporary Art, the Museum offers myriad vistas of sights to those interested. The building itself is a beautiful piece of Architecture and we found it fairly neat and well maintained. Some areas are used to dump things, which certainly could be avoided.

The stupas and the structural remains that are on display will keep you wondering about the craftsmanship of our ancestors. 
The museum also houses a large collection of coins and is worth taking a tour. Another star attraction is the Egyptian section which houses a mummy. The prehistoric era hosts a collection of fossils and bones of the extinct animals. Make sure you display your camera pass when you enter as the employees can be a bit rude and you might take offence at their tone.

Bharhut, Mathura, Buddhist, Hindu, Gupta era, Kushan: across places, times and styles I saw the richest kaleidoscope of the best...and I have to say, well displayed (an area where museums in India tend to lag) and for the most part, well lit. 
The bonus was a wonderful exhibition of Buddhist Art which covered the gamut from Gandhara to Gupta and beyond, Surely one of the best exhibitions of classical Indian art I've seen in a long while.

In the geology display there was dusty display case upon dusty display case of rocks and minerals. Each area of India appeared to be represented but often the same type of common rock or mineral appears in each display. The same in the fossil collection. Dusty display case after display case of small fossils. Fragments of shells from the cretaceous. Nothing really stands out. The most interesting were probably the dusty plaster casts of the ichthyosaurs high up on top of the wall cabinets, that were also full of dusty often unlabelled fossils, We saw signs directing to toilets but saw no where that you could purchase bottled water or snacks.

Don't bother,Jeremy H,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,21-Feb-16,"The building is architecturally impressive but many of the rooms are closed for 'refurbishment'. The Rs 500 entry charge for foreigners (Rs 20 for Indians) is a rip-off, and completely unnecessary - by turning 'visitors' into 'customers' you raise expectations of value-for-money: which it isn't!

Unbelievably bad,Charan L,"Danville, California",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,21-Feb-16,"There is not decent thing to say about a museum, other than that they allow you to pictures in some areas. From a western point of view, this is just about the worst looking Museum of a major country you will ever see. 

The building which was likely built by the British is allowed to decay with not one cent spent either maintenance or improvement. The hall ways are dusty, dirty and exhibits grimy, glass unclean. Walls are filthy, trash lies in verandas, beautiful regal doors from hundred years and nailed shut by just nailing a piece of wood across them. The garden in the center is just an unkempt small patch that was soaking in two inches of water but had no other bushes or flowers. And yet, what a grand place this could be! It is sad. Construction debris from projects abandoned years ago lies all over. Half the so called galleries are closed. 

To top it all off, both of used the restrooms. They are of course in the ground type and that is okay, the problem was that I do think they had been cleaned (and how easy it is with just a strong wash with a hose) in months or maybe never. The stink was horrifying. 

What the hell is wrong with Indians (I am one!), This place should be a jewel. Whoever is in charge should be fired! More",Feb-16

Secondly I know it's a museum full of old stuff but I really think the exhibits could be cleaned occasionly as most of the stuff had so much dirt on it, it looked like it had just been dug up out of the ground. Third and last, as usual with most Indian heriatage sites half the place is closed and has been closed for the past 10 years so any visit is very limited.

We spent nearly 2.5 hours inside the museum and didn't get bored at all. Some parts had been renovated in a most modern way which enhanced the attractions. There is an ordinary restaurant at the back which is ok to have a quick bite in case you are hungry. The restaurant stuffs were pretty friendly which is why I did mention about the restaurant.

I am however, at a loss to see how anyone could find this a fulfilling experience. It was an absolute disgrace. The few exhibits available were not well displayed and were poorly curated. 
Visiting on the last day of our vacation, we were looking forward to rounding off our month with this attraction. Instead we found a once beautiful building now neglected and tired, housing only the barest of exhibitions. 
It was the weekend, so we were prepared for crowds and even the ever present dust which coated everything. What we did not expect, was that there would be only five or so rooms open. 
Apology notices on empty stands and on the closed doors explained that many exhibits were on loan or otherwise unavailable. None of this information was given at the ticket office, where tickets for foreigners had gone from 150 INR to 500 INR per person as of January. Not a problem for us, if there had been anything much to see. 
Except for the few dust encrusted cases in the rooms we did see, a total waste of time until all the exhibitions are restored to the museum. Even then they will need a permanent person to clean the cases to enable proper viewing. More",Jan-16

Visit it for the architecture of its building,Ridha K,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,14-Jan-16,"I was really disappointed. I was expecting a real museum that is comparable to other museums in the west or even in neighboring countries such as china. 

This is similar to what you see in movies about museums of the beginning of the twentieth century. In my view, the curator of the museum and the manager need to be put on a plane and taken to visit one of the museums in China or a little bit further in Europe. 

The museum is crowded with artifacts that are barely explained or documented. The geological collection is huge and the visitor gets lost between the thousands of rocks and fossiles. I guess 99% of the visitors get no ideas about the artifacts and rocks presented. Parts of the museum look like amusement park for kids. 

The two sections that I personally found interesting are the fabric section and coin section. 

The building alone is worth the visit. Its colonial architecture is really interesting. I enjoyed examining the features of the building more than the collection of the ""museum"". 

The ugly part of the visit is the inflated entry fee for tourists of non Indian origin. They will charge about 10 times what Indian nationals pay. 

In summary, if you have nothing else to do in Kolkata, go visit this place for the architecture of the building. Do not think that you are visiting a museum; you will be disappointed. More",Dec-15

Even though the museum is not very well maintained (dust gathering on statues, holes in walls from which statues have been removed for international exhibitions, cobwebs), its collection makes it worthwhile for a 1.5 - 2 hour visit.

To me, this is daylight robbery. My husband even conceded that for us to pay INR200 as foreigners would have been less of an insult.

To be honest, it has its own charm. The charm of the ancient. But it's quite chaotic as a result.

It's hard to find the entrance, and all the open gates will have a security guard yelling at you. At the ticket booth the clerk charged me for a photo pass that I didn't even ask for. This was on top of the elevated foreigner price. Seriously- COUNT YOUR CHANGE. 
Next letdown, despite paying full price, at least half of the place was closed. The painting galleries which I really came to see were shuttered. The third floor was entirely off limits. Other galleries were shut all over the place. Even the central courtyard which used to be pretty swanky has been reduced to a plain patch of grass. 
On the plus side, the Buddhist/Hindu sculpture was exquisite. And the experiments in taxidermy were unintentionally hilarious. The fossil and geology wings were almost exhibits in themselves- they looked like they hadn't been touched in more than 100 years.

The archaeology section with it's Egyptian gallery and the anthropology section with its exhibits on the evolution of humans were special attractions. And of course, the zoological section with its fossils and life-like specimens of various life forms... and the huge dinosaurs! The building itself is a huge and imposing early-19th century colonial structure, and probably houses one of the largest collection of specimens, historical memorabilia and priceless artifacts in Asia. However, when I visited in December 2014 (probably a decade after my previous visit) I was shocked at the lack of maintenance and the general feeling of dereliction that pervaded most of the galleries. While museums in other parts of the world have moved on and used new technology and audio-visual aids to showcase their relatively limited exhibits, the Kolkata 'Jadu Ghar' seems to have stood still in some kind of a time warp... dusty and gloomy, almost reluctant to unveil it's treasures (many of the best exhibits were either closed to public or under ""renovation""), almost unwilling to serve up a bit of that 'magic' that I felt every time I visited the place in the 80s and 90s.

This museum has the potential to be one of the most important places of visit for tourists but unfortunately due to the sheer lack of proper management, many are not even aware of its existence. 

It is a real pity and I do hope that authorities would take note of the situation and will take necessary steps to help improve the situation. 

However, despite its shortcomings, for those who have the will to learn and know more about the world and India in particular, this place is an absolute must visit. More",Mar-15
Chaotic museum not worth visiting,Cornelia A,"Vienna, Wien, Austria",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,11-Apr-15,"The museum is well visited but I don't really understand why. Maybe it's because of the nice courtyard. The ground floor looks more like an archive with many different animal bones and even more minerals. The presentation of the exhibit is very poor and you won't find much information except the name of the species in Hindi. On the first floor you'll get a similar picture. Stuffed animals from all over the world, textiles and many Indian stone carvings but hardly any information to read. The air-conditioned Egyptian exhibition upstairs is the nicest room, that would be an example how the museum could look like. 

I would save the money or visit a different museum. More",Apr-15
Really?,Amber M,"Woy Woy, Australia",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,7-Apr-15,"This place is more worth going to just to see how India puts together a museum.. Most things have no description attached to them whatsoever and the ones that do aren't even from India! It's worth going to just to see the taxidermy section full of (TERRIFYING) stuffed dead animals. It's something different and I would say go just to cure your curiosity but don't expect more than that.

I had been to a similar museum in Oxford (UK) once and although that one was much larger than this one, I was really impressed by the Indian museum. The place has a superb collection of items relating to animals, birds, reptiles and water creatures. I really enjoyed the section that dealt with the evolution of human life. The museum also has sections that give us an insight into our history and displays ancient artifacts. The sections about Buddhism and Jainism are also very informative.

The place is very simple, calm and rich. Geological stones, variety of birds, animals etc.... was amazed at the sheer variety the museum maintains. This multipurpose Institution with multidisciplinary activities has six sections comprising thirty five galleries of cultural and scientific artifacts namely Art, Archaeology, Anthropology, Geology, Zoology and Economic Botany. The museum building is massive and the gardens are decent. However, the building requires a lot of maintenance, particularly indoors.

I am not sure if many people are aware of this beautiful structure with it humble beginnings, glorious past and a role model for other museums in the country. Indian Museum was founded by the Asiatic Society in 1814, and houses some exquisite collection of artefacts viz. An Egyptian Mummy, the Buddha’s Ashes, the Ashoka Pillar to name a few. 

It is actually a multipurpose museum and houses different sections like Archeology, Zoology, Botany, Anthropology etc. It is also the largest of its kind in Asia-Pacific.

The Lost Heritage...,HarjitG,"Chicago, Illinois",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,19-May-14,"My wife and I were very fortunate to have left the Indian Museum as the last tourist attraction on our last day in Kolkata as it was International Museum day which we were completely unaware of (also meant not having to pay entrance fees, which if you are not an local / Indian, can be a pain at times to justify the extra ""uplift"" for tourist prices. We did have to pay 50 rupees though for our camera, which we happily did as it allowed us to take pictures of some of the artifacts of interest without any hassle from the staff). 

The museum itself reflects an era where once were housed some amazing pieces of history. There are still remnants of this, albeit, there are some pieces / sections which require immediate restoration due to weathering or pure neglect. There was plenty of building work going on and there are some new sections in the museum (human evolution and history of coins in India from the Moghul through to the British occupation) which are worth seeing. We enjoyed the visit to India's largest museum but others may not. More",May-14
Worth a Visit,Brian P,"New York City, New York",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,17-May-14,Entrance to the temple for Indians is free but for a foreigner like myself it is IR150. Whenever I visit a city I try my best to visit its museum/s as I find this gives one a very good insight to the history and civilization of the country and its people. The Indian Museum does give you an appreciation of the great history of India. The section dealing with fossils was the most extensive I've seen anywhere and seems geared mainly to scientists.

Disgraceful Neglect,Vincent M,"New Orleans, Louisiana",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,9-May-14,"The Indian Museum in Kolkata has--so they say--dozens of galleries with large collections ranging from Indian, Javanese and Egyptian antiquities, to fossils, meteorites, textiles, masks, paintings and gems. It was the first modern museum in Asia, and is housed in a large and spacious building dating from British days. The majority of the galleries are closed to the public, and apparently have been closed for a very long time, for renovation. ""Closed"" means the public isn't allowed inside, but quite a few are open to view--doors gaping open on the other side of a barricade, with large piles of rubbish collecting dust. Whatever collections had once been housed in the galleries are long gone, and don't appear likely to return anytime soon.

Comparing the state of this museum with the care given to the Victoria Memorial (say, the collection of arms or the gallery of Indian national leaders) only a mile away, you have to ask, ""What is heaven's name is going on at the Indian Museum""? 

You don't even have to go across the Maidan to the Memorial. Within the Indian Museum, the gallery on human evolution is an exception to the general neglect. Even more striking is the numismatics department, which has not only an incredible collection of coins, but demonstrates world-class curator-ship and display. Wonderful coins: look for the war elephant coin of Alexander the Great and the remarkable collections from various Indian states, Every single coin display is extraordinarily well done, and the overall organization is absolutely top-notch. Gold and silver coins looks almost as if they've just been minted. Every coin is backed by photographic enlargements of both the obverse and reverse. In terms of both collection quality and display quality, this numismatic gallery is fully equal to the collection of Roman coins displayed in the Museo Romano or the Chinese coins displayed in the Shanghai Museum--and you can't get much better than that. But in the very same museum, what little else is actually on display is distressing. This priceless repository-- a national heritage--deserves far better than it's getting. 

I've rated the Indian Museum as ""average"" but that's not accurate--the actual works on display (even though they are only the minority of those on the museum's books) are fabulous. The way they are presented is deplorable. If you average 5 for the collection itself and 1 for what the museum's done with it, you get an ""average"" of 3. I do recommend that visitors to Kolkata go to this museum: the collection--even what little is on display--justifies gritting your teeth and going. Don't expect to spend more than an hour or two there, however, because it doesn't merit more than that in its current condition. 

The Museum ""celebrated"" its bicentennial two months ago, in February. Perhaps if you postpone your visit until the tricentennial, they'll have corrected the situation. More",May-14

One area still open is Indian archeological gallery and it is quite impressive, with statues of Hindu god/goddesses as depicted early last millennium. Natural history gallery is also open but looks rather drab. Egyptian history gallery is quite respectable.

First, we went into a sort of paleontology display. Some interesting things, but they could have been laid out that way by grade school kids. Then we went upstairs to displays of some of the varying Indian sub-cultures, Santhals (who are Adivasi), Khasis, many of whom I know (and are not Adivasi but linguistically they seem to come from Southeast Asia). That was pretty well done. Then there were displays of sculptures of gods, and that too was okay. 

The entry fee was okay, only something like Rs. 150. The restroom facilities left something to be desired, and I wish the gift shops had had more. 

There were lots of hustlers outside selling, and trying to get you to their shops. But that's okay. I get to enjoying them. 

If you're expecting a display like you'd see in the United States or Europe, you'll probably be disappointed, though I don't doubt the professionalism or expertise of those responsible for the museum.

There are a lot of the sculptures in the verandah outside the galleries and in the gardens in the centre of the building too. The paintings gallery is really nice with some hand painted manuscripts like the Shahnama and other old Indian manuscripts on palm leaf are really beautiful. Rabindranath and Abanindranath Tagore's paintings are also on display here. 

The Museum's book shop also has a few plaster cast replicas of some of the sculptures on sale at very cheap prices. The books are also worth collecting. More",Dec-12

An ok way to spend the day...,BarbielovesIndia,"Northern Ireland, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,11-Dec-08,"My memory of this place is a little hazy...I'm not sure if that says something about the place or me! I was there last August. It is a large museum. One price for foreigners, one price for Indians! Of course! I'm sorry I can't remember the price but it probably wasn't too expensive. There are several floors..some deal with physical anthropology, the development of people from stone age times and that. That wasn't too impressive as I had seen that kind of thing before. The place is a bit old fashioned looking. Oh don't make the mistake of taking a photo! An alarm goes off! The gardens and the building itself (ON THE OUTSIDE) are beautiful in terms of architecture. I think i read somewhere that is one the oldest museums in Europe. I would recommend allocating a lot of time to go here, as there is a lot to see, and I had to leave without seeing a lot of the place. There was some nice displays of jewellery from different Indian tribes. That was interesting. And also some lovely Buddhist and Hindu statues etc. Not a bad place to spend a few hours away from the humidity :) More",

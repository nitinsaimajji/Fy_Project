Fantastic - if you're lucky enough to have a clear day,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,19-Nov-18,"We were in Darjeeling and Kalimpong for eight days and glimpsed the high Himalaya twice. The air was full of pollution and I suspect that these days it's a rare thing to actually see the mountain range. We were very disappointed. But the one time we did see the mountains it was fantastic. 
Lower your expectations big time if you are going to Darjeeling and/or Kalimpong. You mightn't see the mountains at all. We visited at what is supposed to be the best time of year and we hardly saw a thing.",Nov-18

Mountains are for thoughts and soul searching,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,14-Nov-18,"Kanchenjunga Mountain is the third highest mountain in the world. It lies between Nepal and Sikkim, India, with the three of the five peaks( Main, Central and South) directly on the border, and the remaining two (West and Kangbachen) in Nepal's Taplesjling District. It rises with an elevation of 8,586 m (28,169ft) in a section of the Himalayas called Kangchenjunga Himal. Until 1852, Kanchenjunga was assumed to be the highest mountain in the world, but eventual calculations based on various readings and measurements made by the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India came to the conclusion that Mount Everest was the highest in the world. Visiting this incredible mountain and witnessing the spectacular views of the early morning snow capped top of the mountain and its surrounds, was just simply awesome and breathtaking. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit, and seeing the locals and their way of life, their everyday activities was just awesome. More",Nov-18
Breathtaking,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,13-Nov-18,Just hope for good weather. Although Darjeeling itself is still very nice in the mist. Take a trip to Tiger hill to see the mountain.,Oct-18
short walk from Mayfair,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,12-Nov-18,"walk along the mall to shopping after viewing the mountain. level walk and easy to do. Excellent book store in mall, Oxford",Oct-18
A colour palette,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,9-Nov-18,"It's a bit funny to review a mountain range, but the Kanchenchunga or the Kangchen Dzo-nga - and her attendant peaks - well, it's really no wonder people go crazy! She shows a different mood every hour, and the different colours - pink, orange, white, off white, pale yellow - reflect that. 

Best place to watch this mountain deity is anywhere from Gangtok and elsewhere in the state; visible through the day. And you don't need to go to any specific view point as such. Just walking around gives you great views, given the height. I know Darjeeling has a reputation because of Ray's film; but it's really quite misted over except in some seasons (again, as in the film), and there are so many hotels now that their roofs block the view even when it's clear. Sikkim is better; that's been our experience at least. More",Nov-18
Most spacious place. Best seat in house to see Kanchenjunga. Top class hospitality,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,6-Nov-18,One of the most spacious place to ever stay in Pelling.

Mr. P.K.Mandal is very particular about ensuring highest standard of hospitality services to guests. Highly satisfying experience. They even woke us up early morning at 4am so that we do not miss Kanchanjunga View from hotel window.,Oct-18
Get up early,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,5-Nov-18,Nothing is as breathtaking as watching ng the sunrise turn the mountains pink then gold! Rising at 5.30 became a habit when we stayed in Darjeeling so we could catch the sunrise. Some days it will be misty but if you catch that magic moment it will live with you forever.,Oct-18
Simply fantastic,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,1-Nov-18,This is what sets Darjeeling apart from other hill stations. In spite of being overcrowded and dirty at places ; this mountain range makes every visit worthwhile.,Nov-18
amazing,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,9-Oct-18,We were fortunate to see the mountain from Gangtok and Darjeeling. Lovely and majestic. Had nice weather blessed us Both hotels we were able to see the mountain from of hotel bed. It is a must see.,Sep-18

Sleeping Buddha - Kanchenjunga Mountain Range,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,2-Apr-18,"It was the early days of April/May, and I was on a hunt for some beautiful treks of West Bengal, Sikkim, and Nepal border. I heard as it’s the flowering season of the region, I could spot a much different variety of flora and fauna. Close to 50 varieties of Rhododendron Flower bloom in this season. Thanks to the Expert’s advice from travel magazines, I found it’s the best time to spot red pandas and red pigeons. 
It was damn cold outside, probably in minus, but this is the time my hard work pays off. I tied my shoes, picked up my camera, rolled up my water bottle back into the sleeping bag and head to find a perfect viewpoint for my captures. The next 40 mins of my life were so beautiful that I don’t find enough words to describe it. The first ray on Mt Everest was shining like a diamond, Mt Makalu, and Mt Lhotse, guarding the previous mountain in the middle, tilt your head to the right direction, and you see the range of Mt Kanchenjunga sleeping like meditating Buddha waking up to twitting birds and rising sun and in minutes becomes a Golden Key.

MESMERISING,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-Feb-18,"When we reached Darjeeling sun was shining and it looked a great day ahead. But in the evening while we were strolling at Mall Road it started raining and a mild snow fall.

Woke up next morning at around 6.00 in the morning, removed the curtains and just could not believe myself, Mount Kanchenjunga was standing in front of me in pink colour and the roofs, ground covered in a white sheet of snow. I woke up my wife and we both were flabbergasted, mesmerised, awestruck with beauty of Kanchenjunga. 
You have to see the peaks for yourself to appreciate it's beauty. More",Feb-18
My first glimpse of the Himalayas,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Feb-18,"Since I went in late Nov-early December, I was forewarned that there will be a lot cloudy days. This was certainly the case for me and often I felt disappointment as I could only see bits and pieces of Kanchenjunga peeking through the clouds from any view deck in Darjeeling. 

On my very last day in Darjeeling while enroute to the airport in Bagdogra, the nature gods must be listening and opened this window where the skies fully cleared up briefly and I remember feeling so overwhelmed by the majestic beauty of Kanchenjunga even if I was admiring it from a moving vehicle - but it was alright as I felt honoured by just experiencing it, very humbling experience indeed.

A day in Darjeeling,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,29-Jan-18,This is the only great part of Darjeeling now and forever. The sheer majestic view of this range differentiates this mountain town from all other hill stations in India. You have to see the peaks for yourself to appreciate it's beauty. Darjeeling may be overcrowded and dirty but this range compensates for all its faults.,Jan-18
The snow-clad peaks follow you wherever you go,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,28-Jan-18,"Saw the sunrise from Tiger Hills and the reflection on the snowy peaks changing colour. Awesome. The peaks were also visible from the resort's dining hall and there was also a view=point from which we could observe them. Everywhere we went, it was as if the peaks were following us.",Jan-18
Sleeping Buddha,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,28-Jan-18,"The name Kan- mean head, chen- mean belly and jungha- mean knee. So, if you can clearly view this three top at same time, you could see that Buddha is sleeping. 
That's why this hill is also known as sleeping Buddha.",Apr-17
Amazing view,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,23-Jan-18,"The charming view of Kanchenjunga is more beautiful from Batasia Loop than Tiger Hills. From Batasia Loop we see the mind capturing scene of Kanchenjunga, Indo China border, Indo Nepal border etc. At Tiger Hills, the view is colourful. The Kanchenjunga Peaks glitter with yellow, light red colour from the rays of sun before it's rise, a magnificent view.",Dec-17

It’s huge and high enough,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,14-Jan-18,"It’s long way to reach there to see this huge mountain. 
We took Jeep taxi 150rp from siliguri to Darjeeling for 3hrs. 
I think we don’t have any place in the world like Darjeeling where we can see 8000m mountain without climbing.",Dec-17
Majestic Majesty,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,8-Jan-18,"Whole range facing northern part of Darjeeling, present loveliest view. Whole range contains about dozen peaks that stands over 20000 ft above sea level. In Darjeeling, it's visible from Darjeeling tourist lodge managed by West Bengal tourism development. Rooms offer clear and intermittent view of range. It's viewable from Batasia loop too. Highest peak in middle of range is Kanchenjunga which is third highest peak in world. One side of mountain falls in India while other in Nepal.",Jan-18

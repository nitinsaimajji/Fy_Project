Awesome!!!,thisizarif,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Feb-19,This zoo is very much structured. They have maintained is very precisely. Just follow their direction to roam around.,Nov-18
Wildlife zoo,debashreen2018,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,17-Feb-19,Went there with friends.spend around 1.5 hours in zoo & HMI together.Snow leopard Royal bengal tiger Himalayan fox are some of the animals which we have not seen earlier. So for us it was a nice experience. Also there's a shop near HMI where you can click photos with traditional dresses on rent. Tickets are 60/ person for both zoo & HMI together.,Feb-19
Costly and unhygienic. Very high price of ticket,srkkingfan,"Navi Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,14-Feb-19,If you are a family of more than 4 to 5 then i will say you have to spend a lot to see few animals. Though the zoo is having animals around but the animals are not given proper food and are not taken care properly. There cages are not clean and the places where they sit and spend their time is very dirty. They take 60 rupees. ITS A HUGE Amount. Per person 60 rupees just to see few animals is a big amount. Earlier it was 40 rupees but now it is 60/-. Its too much.,Feb-19
Wildlife zoo,cooker3000,"Dublin, Ireland",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,6-Feb-19,Entry into the wildlife park is twinned with a ticket for HMI. I have to say I am not a big fan of zoos or wildlife parks generally so I probably wouldn't have visited this by itself. The enclosures are ok but they are wildlife and you wish they were bigger.,Oct-18
Not at all looked after.,Debu78,"Asansol, West Bengal, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,5-Feb-19,"We felt that the zoo is not at all properly looked after by the concerned authorities.Most of the animals seem to starve, with lean and feeble body. Cages are neither clean and nor hygenic. I really felt bad about the animals there. Entry fee is Rs. 60 per head but maintanance is poor.",Dec-18
One of the best well kept zoos I have visited,Milind P,"Pune, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,4-Feb-19,"Located about 5 kms form central Darjeeling this is a must visit place of Darjeeling.

Clean and silent.,Mperor,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,2-Feb-19,A very good number and varieties of animals. They are not cramped and have spacious living. One important word of appreciation to authorities is they've have nicely marked the route map by painting the direction on the road. You will neither miss nor get confused. There will be orderly movement of tourists.,Dec-18

Small zoo,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,18-Jan-19,"Visited as part of a tour of attractions in and around Darjeeling. 
Small zoo with quite a few empty enclosures. Most of the animals were kept in small cages. 
Steep climb; can be difficult for elderly and physically challenged. 
Had a few big cats -- jaguar, royal bengal tiger, etc -- and a very small aviary. The main attraction was the red panda. 
The zoo appeared to be clean and well maintained. 
Overall: Small zoo with limited number of animals. You won't miss much if you skip it but, perhaps, worth a visit if you have small children.",Jan-19

Zoo darjeeling,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,27-Dec-18,"Great joy to see the zoo despite little time. Snow leopard, beer, tiger etc. Are main attraction. Mountaineering institute is worth to see",Dec-18
Highlight of the trip,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Dec-18,"More than the rarity of the animals at display, was touched by the way they have been kept - neat and spacious enclosures with an overall peaceful atmosphere. A must do on every traveller's list though the tip would be to do it immediately as the place opens in the morning - to avoid the typical tourist crowds later in the day.",Nov-18
Nice small Zoo,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,21-Dec-18,It is a nice zoo which is maintained well with some uncommon animals like red panda. The zoo has been developed very nicely and you feel nice walking around with greenery all around. A good place to spend an hour or two.,Dec-18
The animals in the Zoo were all looking well fed and well looked after,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,20-Dec-18,"It was very pleasant to slowly amble around the Park to look at all the animals. They were all well fed and kept in large enclosures with ample space and good shelter. The tigers were especially magnificent, and there is also a rare snow leopard, with spots on silvery-white fur, which I have never seen before. It was very interesting to see the Red Panda here, it is much smaller than the black and white Pandas, and is very cute!",Nov-18
Good one,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,16-Dec-18,Nice place to hangout for a day.... We can see many endengered species there..... Nice place.....just outside the city.....,Dec-18
Its okay! Something is better than nothing,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,15-Dec-18,"It's an okay zoo. It's nice because it has some unusual animals that you would not see in other places. Snow leopard, red panda, Himalayan goats, yak, Himalayan sheep, black leopard etc. 
The road is steep and hence it's a bit troublesome for people with less physical endurence. Tickets are too costly for this zoo- 60 rupees! Not worth it. But then again it covers the mountaineering institute too. If you have kids, definitely visit this place.",Dec-18
"A small zoo, with uncommon animals",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,7-Dec-18,"Great place to observe some uncommon & rare animals like the red panda, snow leopard, clouded leopard, black panther, etc. But more animals/birds should be added to the zoo.",Nov-18
A zoo in the mountain and a Mountaineering Institute,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,6-Dec-18,"Kids would love this place. My 6 year old jumped with joy seeing the mighty snow leaopard, black panther, the huge tiger and of course the lazy and sleepy red panda. What makes this zoo different from the other zoo is the area and its layout. Keeping in view of its occupants' natural habitat, the various varieties of deers, mountain goats, wolves, fox, this mountain zoo has ensured that they have ample space to move around, rather climb up an down. 
Another attraction is the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute which has an interesting collection of mountain gears, information about the Himalayan flaura and fauna, about the tribal and collections brought in by various mountaineers as a memoir of their expedition. 
Alltogether it would be a wonderful experience to spend some time there and ofcourse there is no count of the amount of calories you would burn, which is always a welcome. More",Nov-18

This place should figure on your go-to list.",Dec-18
Beautiful,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,3-Dec-18,"A very small sized zoo that's been made to cater for the Himalayan specific fauna of the region. So run into Antelopes, tigers, leopards and most famous Red Panda, which are by the way, too cute. The entry fee is very nominal and they have restrooms and tea stalls inside. Do visit the HMI and the museums inside during the tour. Best place to bring kids.",Nov-18
A glimpse of some mountain predators,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,1-Dec-18,"A beautifully laid out zoological park with a decent variety of wildlife - predators, birds and snakes.

"Wonderful Zoo,one must visit at Darjeeling",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,27-Nov-18,"By the word Zoo,many people may think what to see there beyond any city zoo,but the idea is totally wrong. Here at Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park,lots of Himalayan animals and birds are kept for visitors.One can also see Royal Bengal tiger here,but animals and birds of Himalayan range are surely added attraction here.One must have enough time to see everything,it takes three to four hours to properly cover all parts. One can see Himalayan bear,Himalayan Wolf,Red Pandas, varities of peacock class birds and panther to name a few.One has to walk a bit,but proper resting places are also available.Remember please,it closes at 4-30 AM",Oct-18
Visit to Zoo,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,25-Nov-18,A good assortment of animals. Fortunate to see Bengal Tiger. Long and steep walk. Animal numbers are limited.,Oct-18
WELL DONE!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,24-Nov-18,"I normally do not like visiting zoos as I do not like to see animals in such tiny enclosed spaces, but I must say that this is not the case with Darjeeling Zoo. It has been well maintained and all the animals look healthy and well taken care of. As we were staying at Little Tibet Resort, we were only a leisurely 15 minutes walk away from the zoo. The first day, we arrived in the afternoon and we were a bit rushed as zoo was closing soon. It was also a bit crowded and there were a few tourists misbehaving with the animals. This is one area I feel that the zoo could improve on. They should have more guards around the area watching over these tourists and take strict action against them. 
Next day, we walked back again at the opening time itself. There were very few people at the time and it was a lovely experience. The Bengal Tiger, snow leeopard and red panda were all out and enjoying themselves in the relative quietness of the moving in the absence of rowdy tourists. After spending almost 3 hours at the zoo, we walked to Shruberry Nightingale park on our way back to Little Tibet for lunch. Must visit place for all people, but would recommend it more in the morning before it gets crowded. More",Oct-18
Hmalayan beauty,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Nov-18,"One can see the Himalayan beasts here specially Red Panda, Snow Leopard & white Wolf. Within the zoo the Bengal Natural History Museum is awesome.",Nov-18
Biggest problem is parking,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,16-Nov-18,Huge problem of parking for tourist in Darjeeling zoo. More then 300 meters to walk just to reach zoo entrance.,Nov-18
Best zoo in the country,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,12-Nov-18,"Arguably the best maintained zoo in the country. There are quite a few rare animals of high altitudes. The red panda and black panther are unique. The zoo is clean and although not the biggest, packs quite a few uncommon animals. A must see during the Darjeeling trip. 
Be prepared to walk up and down the slopes though. BUT it is worth it!!!",Nov-18
Not great,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,12-Nov-18,"This zoo is full of sad animals kept in solitary confinement. It's ok for an Indian zoo and, no doubt, the animals are well cared for generally - but you might find it depressing. Not much to do in Darjeeling so you'll probably end up here anyway. Be prepared...",Nov-18
Reasonable collection of animals,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,6-Nov-18,"The big cats were the highlight of this park. The royal Bengal tiger, snow leopard, common leopard were the star attractions.",Nov-18
ZOO- Should Visit if Travelling with Kids,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,6-Nov-18,"It's a ZOO- that's it is. If traveling with young kids of age 10 years or so, it's a place to visit in Darjeeling. Kids will definitely have good time. 

Himalayan Red Panda is main attraction there ... 

Take some snacks with you which your kids like to eat.

Himalayan wildlife and mountaineering museum at one place,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,5-Nov-18,Good place to visit with kids. Mountaineering enthusiast would love the HMI museum inside the zoo. The place also offers great view of Darjeeling town.,Nov-18
Best ever views of red pandas,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,5-Nov-18,"The zoo is set on the side of a steep hill. You need good lungs to reach the top! 
The views of the red pandas were terrific. We loved seeing yaks, but felt sorry for the big cats, especially the snow leopard. It looked very old and tired. We got good views of the Himalayan wolves, we had never seen them before. 
Worth about an hour of your time to get a glimpse of Himalayan wildlife.",Oct-18

Animals in their original habitat,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,25-Sep-18,"Pleasantly surprised by the zoo. I have been to major zoos around the world and was preparing for the worst. The barking deer, Yak, and other mountain animals were on steep hillsides. They had lots of natural greenery. The only animals I was concerned with were the cats, but when are caged cats ever in a good environment. Lots of greenery once again. My only complaint was the visitors. They were calling to the animals and whistling at the cats. Even though there were signs to be quiet and don't tease the animals. They need employees to be there educating the visitors on proper zoo behavior. 
They had a museum section, with taxidermy. Bad job there, the animals did look dead. Poorly done, some birds looking like they were just shot and laying there. More",Sep-18

This time we did not find the second royal bengal tiger and heard about his/ her demise because of old age . However this information requires verification. This time we missed the woolves also. 

Black Panther, Snow Leopard , Chitah , Yaks, Bears, Deers , Blue Sheeps etc and of course Red Pandas all are there and seemed to be in good shape. 

The bird cage has been shifted to the Red panda area. 

There is a small restaurant within the zoo and one can find it just on the Road taking the turn to Leopard cages.Food is good , mainly chineese, and price is reasonable. Two separate Toilets are also maintained near the Bear enclosure.

Places to visit,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,7-Aug-18,"What a fantastic outing spent at this extraordinary zoo. We would never have been able to view a tiger, panther or panda if we hadn't visited.

Must visit Zoo in Darjeeling,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,3-Aug-18,"Fantastic zoo, with animals like Tiger, Snow Leopard, Bear, Deer, Yak, Red Panda, Exotic Birds & Reptiles all available. People who like watching these animals must go. And it is a must if you have kids with you they would love it. 

40% animals are kept in protected open area, so it really feels like watching them in real without any cage. 
Tigers and other wild animals are kept in cage for obvious reasons :) 

Also the location is fantastic the clouds come at any time makes the place feel like heaven. 

You will need at-least 2-3 hours to see the entire place at peace.",Jul-18
Badly maintained,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,30-Jul-18,This zoo needs make lager enclosures for the animals . ......... Signs of distress on every animal that's exibited.,May-18
Interesting,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,28-Jul-18,Really nice Zoo and well maintained. Spotting Red Panda was really nice. Nice place to hang out with Kids.,Jun-18
"Good place if you're a ""Biology Guy""",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,26-Jul-18,"Basically I'm not a Zoo guy. I mean I don't like to watch caged animals. Nevertheless this place has got couple of endemic mammals and iconic Himalayan Red Panda. It's not that big rather calling it small will be appropriate. But still it has great variety of long trees which remain surrounded by clouds all the time. 
You have to pay extra 10 rupees for your camera.",Jul-18
Wow!!!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Jul-18,It's nice to visit the Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park. They have a wide range of animals in this zoological park. I would love to visit again.,Jul-18
Zoo park,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,18-Jul-18,"Nice place to visit to witness many exotic Himalayan animals, the zoo enclosure s are way too small and one can find stressful behaviour of animals, would be much better if it's a bigger place, nethertheless it's worth a visit",Jun-18

A gem if a bit rundown,garhuff,"Atlanta, Georgia",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,4-Feb-19,"This cemetery serves as a reminder of the British elite who came to India to earn their fame and fortune.

Out of sheer curiosity!!,Padmini S,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,22-Jan-19,I had heard so much about this place and hence decided to visit it on a winter afternoon in December. The cemetery became functional in 1767 and closed down in 1790. Well maintained they charge an entry fee and walking around we had a lot to explore. Henry Louis Vivian Derozio has been buried here. Longevity was a major issue with all those who had been laid to rest here as most of them did not cross forty and needless to say they were mainly Europeans. Probably they succumbed to the heat of the Indian subcontinent. This peaceful environment gives you time to ponder over so many things. One particular tomb was a comfortable bed for an old woman. It was a wonderful experience being here. More,Dec-18

In the heart of the bustling Kolkata traffic, office goers hurriedly crossing over, there lies a place completely enveloped in serenity. The South Park Street cemetery situated few yards from the junction of Park Street & Mallick bazar, along the stretch of AJC Bose Road is a must visit if you want a brief respite from your busy schedule.

Interesting Place To Visit But Could Be Better,Marianneford,"London, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,3-Dec-18,"The cemetery is very well maintained, whilst also retaining a slightly over-grown natural feel. I stayed for under an hour and found it an interesting place to walk but feel some more information about the history of the place and the people buried there would have enhanced the experience.

The groundsmen do a fantastic job of maintaining the graves but still allow a feeling of peace and undisturbed nature to prevail.

Gorosthaney Shabdhan,rajarshi2016,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,22-May-18,"Was there on a rainy day - the caretaker at the entrance asked us to be on the look out for snakes. Had read Satyajit Ray's Feluda book umpteen times earlier - but thsi was really about being Shabdhan (careful) in the Gorosthan (cemetery). I was accompanying a friend of mine who was visiting Calcutta. He has a special place in his heart for a certain Henry Loius Vivian Derozio - poet, teacher, educator, radical & free thinker - all this before he so tragically died of cholera at the age of 22. We managed to locate his grave & just stood there in silence, thinking about the man who started the Young Bengal movement at the age of 17, brought about social reform and inspired so many young Bengali youth to open themselves to free thought.

Haunting beauty,TargaTripper,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Mar-18,"Beautiful location and so very peaceful. A peaceful oasis in the centre of the city.

Refreshing in the city and full of peace,Jo S,Cirencester,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,17-Mar-18,Not our usual thing to visit a cemetry on a trip to India but so pleased we did.

Beautifully kept with a real sense of history.,Mar-18
An extraordinary experience both poignant and uplifting,Doctorichard,"Basingstoke, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,9-Mar-18,"Thanks to the efforts of volunteers over the past 40 years this remarkable monument survives. Thousands of large mausoleums bear witness to the personal wealth of European (mostly British) travellers in the 18th and 19th century who made Calcutta a home far from home. Many died young, very many only in their 20s, but the tributes recorded are both touching and remarkable for the ambition they represent. We enjoyed a couple of hours picking through this little oasis of quiet and times past. Thoroughly recommended if you enjoy a bit of history and personal tales.",Mar-18
Fascinating,Thornpilot,"Bristol, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,8-Mar-18,"Interesting place, though it does not warrant spending more than hour here. moving to see how old some of the memorials/graves are",Feb-18

Apart from that Henry Louis Vivian Derozio's remains are here. this place gives us the touch of history and nostalgia, the stories we have heard about the great humans, few of them lying here and nostalgia as we walk down the line so greenery and peaceful.

A historical treasure,PranaAustralia,Australia,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-Feb-18,"This was one of the more interesting places I visited in Kolkata. It is not a fixture on the tourist circuit. Located on the fashionable Park Street, the entrance to the Cemetery is so nondescript that it is easy to miss it. Once inside, the visitor is transported to a different era. There are numerous mausoleums and they are like the pages of a history book. The stories of individuals making requisite reading and tell us of lives that form the fibres of the tapestry that is India. Many of the structures are in a state of repair and will probably be destroyed by the assails of the weather or the roots of the vegetation that abounds the cemetery. The spot is serene and it is not difficult to spend an hour or two in the quiet surroundings of the cemetery. The architecture of the mausoleums ranges from simple structures to elaborate European designs. A few have incorporated elements of Indian designs (e.g. Kalinga). This place is definitely worth a visit. More",Jan-18
Well worth a visit,AnthonyD2402,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,10-Feb-18,This place is very interesting - the graves of the people of the East India Company and others mostly British and most of whom died young. Not just 'a grave' some of these are huge mausoleum type structures. The place is well maintained and good for a hour or so. Definitely worth a visit. Small R50 entry fee.,Feb-18

Fascinating piece of history,rwaldstein,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,28-Jan-18,This is a very fascinating place to visit that will teach you a lot about the history of Calcutta.

Hard to find and still in use!,Sophie M,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,4-Jan-18,"Don't go out of your way to visit the South Park Street Cemetery unless you are really into cemeteries! The entrance can be a little tough to find, it is across from the Institute of Neuroscience. I was also under the impression that the cemetery was no longer in use - not true, it is an active cemetery and we walked into a funeral.",Dec-17
It can be a starting point for tour in Kolkata,ShashankaSaadi,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,2-Jan-18,"This is an ancient cemetery dated back to 1700 centuries. It was closed around mid-1800 century. Nice and quite place to spend few hours, know the patterns of first inhabitants of Kolkata when it was growing a town. I liked it.",Dec-17
Yet another hidden gem,Famrave,"Bristol, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Dec-17,Although this is mentioned in most guide books - it can be very easily missed - but do not do so - it is comparable to the great cemeteries in Paris and in Glasgow - the vast tombs are overwhelming as are the poignant inscriptions to many very young people who never left India. It is now closed at night - apparently the tourists were disturbing the ghosts!!!,Nov-17
Nice surprise,Radrk734,"Ann Arbor, Michigan",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,8-Dec-17,A fellow I met on the street recommended visiting. I enjoyed reading the tombstones and taming photos. The cemetery has unique lighting filtering,Dec-17
Atmospheric and poignant,RPHWoking,"Woking, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,30-Nov-17,"What an interesting historical site to visit right next to the hustle and bustle where you can walk around in piece and quiet spending as much time as you like reading the memorial inscriptions and getting a feel for those that created Calcutta.

Serene experience walking through this place,AnkurPankur,"Pune, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,8-Nov-17,"The location of this place is on the famous & busy Park Street. It's ticketed and quite well-maintained (from a tourist point of view). 

It was a serene and somewhat peaceful experience walking through this place. It's an old cemetery, so you expect to feel spooked or little fuzzy (it's supposed to be one of the most haunted places in India), but during the day, the illusion is broken by the many visitors, a few couples trying to steal some private time and the tall modern buildings on the horizon of this place. We kept reading many of the epitaphs, surprised to find that so many those buried here died very young. There were even whole families buried together, some who died within a span of few months or years. There must be so many stories here to tell. 

There are a few tombs of note - the one of Hindoo Stuart (adorned with many Hindu deities) and Sir William Jones (probably the biggest tomb), the great philologist who ""discovered"" the link between Indian and European languages. More",Oct-17
A unique glimpse into the Raj,DaleLee1954,"Patan (Lalitpur), Nepal",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,6-Nov-17,I first visited the Park Street Cemetery back in 1979 - then in a dilapidated state. My last visit was 20 years ago. In many ways the cemetery is like walking into a living history book - a unique glimpse into the East India Company & the Raj in India. I know now that I am ‘old’ - given the age-of-death written on many of the tombstones. An excellent visit in all regards.,Nov-17
Another slice of history - set in stone,John L,"London, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,4-Nov-17,"Also known as The Great Cemetery of Asia - the resting place of two centuries' worth of worthies from the time of British India. Partially restored, but many of the epitaphs are difficult to read, which is sad. The stone masons seemed to have vied with each other to have produced ever bigger and better monuments, resulting only in uniformity. Savour for an hour or so, but beware the mosquitos (dengue?) at dusk. Also a meeting place for young lovers.",Oct-17
Interesting to some,David A,"Greater Sydney, Australia",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,26-Oct-17,This is a very ancient cemetery with little interest to most people. Not recommended when there is much more to explore and enjoy in this fascinating City,Oct-17
British Cemetery,fancynancynator,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Oct-17,I was given a tour of this cemetery by the guide I hired from the university to show me the architectural sights of Calcutta. It is elegiac and evocative and a must see in my favorite Indian city.,Dec-16

The dead souls of the past are lying in this place. The cool damp place, with mosses over the tombs give a feeling of the past history. People died in the years of 1740, 1800 are all buried here. The plaques on the tomb show the details of the person buried. The tombs are of different style, structure, design. People from different continents are sleeping here.

A Cemetery With Victorian Charm!,RaghuRajMurmu,"Jamshedpur, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,9-Apr-17,"Situated after the Park Street, you need to make an entry in the 'Visitor's Register' at the entrance, this allows you to spend around two hours in the premises without any hassle. However, no one checks if you have spent more than two hours there or less. 

You may have to take permission for commercial photography or videography from the managing authority's office at the entrance. 

Now the best part, this cemetery hosts some celebrities of the British East India Company as well as their high-rank officers and soldiers. Most of the latter died due to the infection that they had due to the injuries that they sustained while fighting the Pahariya & Santals. The numerous 200 years old monuments and graves are more or less in a good condition, which also reflects the taste as well as architecturally superior designs of that era.

A lovely little oasis,Elizabeth J,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,4-Apr-17,"This cemetery is one of the most interesting I've been to. I could compare it to Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, but it's just way smaller. 

The architecture of the tombs varies from style to style, and it's very interesting to walk amongst them and just admire the structure, even if the details of the person has been eroded. 

Other reviews complain about the state of the stone tombs and the pathways being rocky and unpleasant to walk on. Whilst I agree that some of the pathways seem a little neglected, you have to take into consideration how old some of the tombstones are, and that it's just normal for them to degrade. I also did see maintenance work underway. 

My only issue is that the price for a person without a camera is 20rs, and a person with a camera is 50rs. Although we didn't intend to take photos we let slip that we had a camera in one of our bags and even though we explained that we didn't intend to take photos the lady said ""You'll still have to pay 50rs."" Which I didn't find very satisfactory.

They include many Indo-Saracenic elements too. Try to find the tomb of Charles ""Hindu"" Stuart. It is a unique and composite brick structure built in the ‘pancharatna’ manner, with a central dome flanked by miniature replicas of Orissan ‘rekha deul’ on four sides. Charles Stuart (c. 1758–31 March 1828) was an officer in the East India Company Army and is well known for being one of the few British officers to embrace Hindu culture while stationed there, earning the nickname Hindoo Stuart. Also the tomb of Sir William Jones is very impressive. The oldest grave in this graveyard is of Mrs.S.Pearson.(1768).

Historical figures, important people, you name it and their graves were here. It seemed like I was walking through history. You can walk any which way and it gave me the freedom to explore the place. Photography is prohibited but it pained me to see everyone flouting the rule. You might want to sit down for a bit in these calm, serene surroundings and ponder on life in general. I did and it was beautiful. 

In its guise to save these 'monuments', they have on them written in red' endangered by tree roots', something I found marring the beauty of the place and it almost seemed offensive to me. 

There were roots going in and outside of graves, making you wonder at how powerful nature is if left to its own devices.

The road used to be called Park Street, and prior to that Burial Ground Road. 
The Park Street Cemetery, was one of the earliest non-church cemeteries in the world, and probably the largest Christian cemetery outside Europe and America in the 19th century. It still houses the remains of the colonial elite-bureaucrats, military officials, the mercantile big wheels and their families in the glory days of the Raj. As Rudyard Kipling remarked disdainfully in 1891: ‘men were rich in those days and could afford to put a hundred cubic feet of masonry into the grave of even so humble a person as “Jno. Clements, Captain of the Country Service, 1820”. 

Others of a more literary bent of mind are amazed that Walter Savage Landor’s “Rose Aylmer” was a real person who lies buried here. As does William Makepiece Thackeray’s father, and one of Charles Dickens’ sons. Not to speak of the pride of Young Bengal, Henry Louis Vivian Derozio, poet extraordinaire and leader of dissidence against all forms of orthodoxy, who took the city by intellectual storm in his brief life of 22 years, and the bicentenary of whose birth is being celebrated on 18 April 2009.

Word of advice, for Rs 100 you can purchase a small booklet at the gatehouse on the way in which will help you 'meet the people' buried around the cemetery. I had a great guide who was able to lead me from one magnificent tomb to the next, but the book would have been helpful, and a must without the guide. 

It's atmospheric the city sounds are quickly erased and filled with the sound of crows circling the tree tops, they only add to the character. 

It's not a pristine place, much work has clearly been done to bring the cemetery back from it's jungle overgrowth and the band of volunteers have to my sincere thanks. But, it's agonizingly dilapidated in some places. 

I took a good hour+ to walk around, not for all I'm sure, but it was easy for me to get lost in the tales of colonial 'Calcutta'. You can't help but wonder at the challenging lives the people buried here and the stories behind their contributions to Calcutta's growth.

Choose a winter day, preferably before lunch, pack a small camera to keep memoirs and capture the final abode of many legendary Historic figures.

As of two days ago, there were still a few feral dogs in the southern reaches of the cemetery (put on a fierce front but easily shooed away) and three or four poor folk (kept to themselves, harmless, only saw one ruined crypt with a plastic tarp providing shelter from sun and rain). Keeping aggressive greenery under control is a constant challenge but the caretakers are winning the battle. You can buy a pamphlet at the caretakers' lodge, beside the entrance, for Rs 100, and it helps support the continuing restoration efforts. Find a particular gravesite is difficult even though the monuments are numbered. If you are looking for the grave of a distant family member, your best bet is to ask one of the caretakers. If he is available, Mr. Kenneth Rodriguez, a Goan by birth, Kolkatan by 60 years residence, and a gentleman of the old school, can help you locate the gravesite, 

Here are a few of the residents. So long as anyone still comes to honor their memory, they're still actively residing in their COD: 

Sir William Jones (1794) orientalist and polyglot, fluent in 13 languages and passably familiar with 28 more. Speaking them all, it struck him that certain words in Latin and Greek shared similar patterns, and also shared them with Gothic, Celtic, Slavic, Sanskrit and Persian. His conclusion wad that a family of Indo-European languages all were descended from one common root, thus he founded modem linguistics. He also was the first president of the Asiatic Society. His father was a mathematician who invented the use of the Greek letter pi. His tombstone is to your left as you enter the cemetery. Easy to spot because the tall obelisk has been replastered and is much brighter that the others. 

A bit west of Jones, Col. Colin MacKenzie (1821) first Surveyor General of India, producing many of the earliest accurate maps of the subcontinent. Served under Raffles in Java. Studied Indian mathematics and logarithms. His collection of Indian manuscripts and art is now in the British Museum and British Library. 

George Bogle: (1781) ordered by the Governor General to enter Tibet and establish diplomatic relations. Ordered by both the Emperor of China and the Panchen Llama of Tibet, not to. He did anyway, wound up spending six months with the Panchen Llama. When he returned to India, Bogle promised the Panchen Llama that he wound found a Buddhist temple on the banks of the Ganges, so Tibetan monks could return to the spiritual roots. When got back, he did. 

Major-General Charles ""Hindoo"" Stuart, (1828) who converted to Hinduism, dressed in Indian garb when off-duty, devoutly bathed in the Hoogley daily, urged Englishwomen in Calcutta to wear saris instead of the Regency fashions, and castigated the attempts of missionaries to convert Hindus as ""impolitic, inexpedient, dangerous, unwise, and insane."" As the only Hindo general officer in town, he pointedly asked: ""If their religion is insulted, what confidence can we repose in the fidelity of our Hindu soldiers?"" Apparently British authorities didn't quite grasp the question until 30 years later, when those sepoys emphatically demonstrated the point, More",May-14

A Cemetery with a different feel ....,abhi-andy,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,11-Apr-14,"Thanks to the Times of India initiative, I was introduced to this serene,charismatic place as a part of the heritage walk. Do not mistake this to be a normal cemetery with row of tombstones; yes you do find them but just can't miss the grandeur of the place which was opened in 1767. Huge structures interspersed with equally regal fauna adds to its majestic charm. Tombs of Sir William Jones - founder of the Asiatic Society,Henry Vivian Derozio - the celebrated poet being the major attractions notwithstanding, all the tombs have their story to share. Bang on Park Street, it's very easy to reach with the cemetery open thru out the day from 8 am onwards. One suggestion - before u embark on your journey plz buy the booklet available at the office near the gate. Serves as a great guide with details and pictures of some important tombs. So go and enjoy history lapped up in nature !!!! More",Mar-14

This houses the tomb of Job Charnock (Pardon the spelling),the discoverer of Kolkata(He called it Calcutta). Other than him you can find the tombs of many people who were buried here during the british era. Some tombs date back to the 18th century.

Paradox - Spooky yet Serene!,Avrag2014,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,24-Feb-14,"Had planned to visit South Park Street Cemetery after I had read rave reviews on this very site. Getting there was not easy as the cabbie did not know the place but thanks to Google Maps, managed to reach the street. When I asked a few locals (supposedly), no one knew about it. Surprising! However there was a wall & I could feel it in my bone that this had to be the place. I asked a guy how I do get on the other side of the cemetery; I hoped he didn’t say by dying (No pun intended). He guided me to the main gate where I met the caretaker, who is a jolly old man & if you have the time, he would be able to give you the history of the place. I was there at 9.00 in the morning since I had to head to work after that. Since this is not a guided tour, I was out on my own.

They were the workers of the cemetery who cleared the fallen leaves and maintained the graveyard. There were quite a few birds & squirrels, and each time they scampered around, a chill ran down my spine. 
Almost each tombstone was unique in its design and architecture. It would be a great learning in architectural styles of the day’s bygone. There were some that had domes, other was pestle shaped, there was Indian temple architecture as well, and intriguing signs on tombstones, intricate inlay designs. I am sure architectural experts would do better justice describing it. 
But what struck my heart were the poems & memorials on the graves. People who loved & people who were loved!! The place houses the graves of so many different people – young infants, children, women, clergymen, war veterans, Viceroys, most of whom died young.

"Old, Dirty...and Wonderful!",AnuradhaGhose,"Calcutta, West Bengal, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,14-Feb-14,"Spent time with the dead today at the Park St. Cemetery. This was my first visit to any cemetery and the one in Park St. was nothing like I expected...yet still, I loved it, perhaps better for failing my imagination. No whitewashed tombs, no flowers on graves; just overgrown grass, stone laden with algae and crow-droppings...centuries old tombs, the letters faded on them. People, so many of them...men, women, children of the 18th and 19th centuries. Who were they? What were they like? What is their story? Sons and daughters of England, buried so far from their motherland in a quiet street corner in India. Love, love, loved it...the ambiance and the experience!

Peaceful...,911bella,Mid Sussex,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,13-Feb-14,"Worth popping into this if you're in the Park Street area. It's a little window into the lives of those Brits who found themselves in Calcutta at the turn of the 19th century. 

You can get a real sense of the life expectancy (particularly of the wives) and some of the graves give a real historical narrative.",Feb-14
Almost unreal,isitmany,"Hong Kong, China",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,11-Feb-14,"It's hard to imagine that this place has stood still, while the rest of the chaotic, noisy, dust-bowl of a city develops around it. I came here to track some of my ancestors, but it's not an easy task due to the fact that the place has decayed to the point that you can't read most of the text on the graves. Staffs/groundskeepers are generous enough to pull out the giant book of all the names and help you out, and they don't seem to be in a hurry at all. 

The grounds itself are as eerie and creepy as it gets. Take some time to read the words on the tombs- there are indeed some pretty interesting people here, and it's a bit unfortunate to see the place falling in to a state of disrepair. More",Jan-14
What a special place!,BK_Vancity,Vancouver,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,11-Feb-14,"This is a really neat spot in south Kolkata. Located on south Park Street just like it sounds, this place is unlike anywhere I've ever seen in India or anywhere! It was an active cemetery for a short period in thge late 1700s and houses the remains and very large and elaborate tombs of British ex pats who mostly seemed to have succumbed to tropical maladies and other dangers of 18th century India. There is a guide you can buy to the tombs, but you are free to wander and ponder. Great photographic opportunities and it is shockingly quiet (especially for Kolkata!)",Jan-14
More Gothic Than Robert Smith,camsean,"Chengdu, China",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,20-Jan-14,"From the point of view of the tourist, this cemetery works on at least two levels: one aesthetic and the other historical. Allow me to address both. 

Aesthetically, it is a wonderfully creepy backdrop to a Gothic novel, with mossy gravestones, the cawing of murders of crows and an eerie sense of quietness in the midst of a chaotic city. Many of the mausoleums are also fantastic works of art, appearing in a variety of shapes: cupolas, obelisks, columned follies and great pyramids of stone. The graveyard verse carved into the 18th and 19th century tombs only contributes to the brooding atmosphere. 

Historically the cemetery is also worthwhile as a record of the sorrows and hardships of the British denizens of Raj-era Calcutta. Clearly disease and disaster struck down many of these ardent empire-builders at a young age. It is regrettable that the British government has not made more attempts at restoration and preservation as some of the tombs are now in a parlous state. More",Jan-14
Eerily quiet stroll,Alli S,Alexandria,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,20-Jan-14,Amazing place to go back in time. Reading the poetry and dedications on the memorials are like reading letters. I wish I had had more time for exploring and talking to the staff here.,Oct-13

There are graves here of people who died way back in the 18th century, all of who's memories have been immortalized in the form of beautifully descriptive obituaries and ornate tombs. These were people from Britain who came down to Cal due to various postings by the Raj, the elite of society back then, people from the army... people who played their small but important roles in the formation of Calcutta. 

There is guide book you can ask the caretaker for at the entrance. The book has a map of the tombs of these people as well as a small note of their contribution to the society they lived in.

Some of the tombs dated well back to 1793 -98 and were of very young men and women, even four day old babies. Even the tombs of later dates, 1800 - 1893 told one singular story, most of the British, Spanish or French people who lived in Calcutta, died young. This could be attributed to the quality of drinking water, malaria or other tropical disease. 

Coming to the architecture, I must say, this cemetery is an outstanding example of Gothic tomb structures. Also the inscriptions on some of them, will bring tears to your eyes.....so very touching and loving.

No one was here when we were visiting, and it was so nice to have some quiet for once! It was almost spooky walking around-lots of big trees and overgrown plants. There are also a lot of birds and smaller animals- I freaked out when a squirrel went right over my head! 

It is also very interesting to see the age of death, cause, etc. It's very sad to imagine some of these young wives who followed their husbands out there, and had lots of children, most of whom died as infants/toddlers due to malaria, etc. The women themselves often died in childbirth. 

It was also pretty interesting to see some of the stones that showed people who died in the uprising as well. 

On the way out, the groundskeeper asked me to sign a log, but that was the only time I saw anyone else! 

Lots of cool photos here! DEFINITELY spend a few hours here! More",Dec-12

Had I been able to average the age of those buried there, I doubt it would read 30 years. Sure there are the elderly, 70 or above. But many, again, were young children, or ladies in their 20s, married, usually, to some of the East India Company bureaucrats and their imperial benefactors. 

And I refer to ""colonialism"" as an historical reality. Doubtless the British felt they were racially superior and it showed in the epitaphs, many of them poetically beautiful. But the stones themselves were majestic! Even for infants, many were far, far more elaborate than their families would have been able to afford back in the UK. 

There's still the haunting element. To walk by the graveyard at night, when the mist and smog still linger over the graves of those buried there, could make up a set in a Bela Lugosi film. That just adds to the charm of the grounds. 

Oh, and there are fewer people living in there now. Many of those who do help maintain the grounds, and make the acreage all the more charming--for lack of a better word. 

Do visit. And, yes, respect the deceased whether you liked their politics or not. This location is a must for those interested in history, perhaps for inspiration to a haunting novel.

The old guys who tend to the gate don't officially ask for anything but we bought one book between the four of us for R100 ($2 USD) which seems like a fair trade given the experience. More",Nov-11
A piece of heaven on earth,Naturefreek2011,"Helsinki, Finland",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,4-Nov-11,"Small, green and mysterious cemetery worth of visiting. Taxis don't find the place as there is no Hindi word for cemetery nor a concept for burial but many people in the street know where it is. Use mosquito repellent.",Sep-11

A very moving experience,GoannaSydney,Sydney,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,8-May-10,"Kolkata was founded in 1690 by Job Charnock of the East india Company Factory in Hugli. What is noticeable from the tombstone inscriptions, is that while men generally survived, their wives and children died young. Mrs Dorothy Smith died in 1798 aged 28. David 7 months, Amelia 3 years 4 months. ""No merit here no works to boast of such is the Kingdom of God."" Thomas Smith, her husband, died in 1815, aged 68 years. And on another: ""1817 our son and two twin brothers that joined him December following."" 
You can reach the Cemetery by walking down Park Street. The lesser known Scottish Cemetery is nearby. A donation for the maintenance of the grounds is appreciated. More",

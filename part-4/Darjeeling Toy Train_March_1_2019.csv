Enjoyed the ride,debashreen2018,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,17-Feb-19,We booked our tickets through irtctc online portal earlier to our Darjeeling visit but we're a bit disappointed by the overall ride. The train moves through the town mainly with very little view of the hills. Takes you to batasia loop and halts for only 10 minutes. But they have a 30 min halt at ghum station but there's nothing much to see except the museum. It's a heritage joy ride and must be experienced when in Darjeeling.,Feb-19
For train enthusiasts,zigsterGoldCoast,gold coast,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,11-Feb-19,"A ride on the toy train is a fun activity for the whole family. An added bonus is that many of the trips use an original steam engine complete with coal burning fire. The trip takes 2 hours and there are several short stops along the way. The seats in the carriages are very comfortable and all seats provide good views. One of the highlights of the trip is the close proximity the train travels to cars, pedestrians and roadside shops and markets.",Feb-19
Not worth it,Swatiib,"Dehradun, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,31-Jan-19,The train which was once the identity of Darjeeling has now lost its charm all because of its route which passes through all concrete jungles. It is not the money it charges at all,Jan-19
Bollywood engine,prrateek,"Hyderabad, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,28-Jan-19,"A playful jolly ride in dhr from Darjeeling to ghoom and back with stops for batasia loop and museum. The steam engine which is a UNESCO site is the best memoir of Darjeeling and Bollywood . The charges are 1400 per person, seats lil cramped , would be great if full 2 hours Bollywood number can be played. Definitely grt",Jan-19
"A Joy Ride, Indeed",akash1209,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,28-Jan-19,"We opted for the 2 hours long Darjeeling-Ghum-Darjeeling joy ride in the Steam Engine Train and it was a pleasant and satisfying experience. 

It’s commendable how they have maintained the really old Steam Engines. 

Loved the small Museum at Ghum Station.",Dec-18
The 'Joy' Train,vish_2_travel,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Jan-19,"'Unmatched experience', to start with I would say about the Toy train . 
In a country like India , even though trains are the lifeline for us to commute/travel , hardly ever one gets such a surreal experience of travelling in the train . 

Where else one can see the engine from so close , railways tracks suddenly have a friendly appearance to them and the heritage experience is paralleled. 

Must for anybody travelling to this part of the world, it is certainly any kid's delight . 

Yes the ticket is tad too expensive, but then both steam/diesel engines have 2 wagons only i.e. max 55 seats . And preserving a century old heritage will cost something, add to it the fact that all of those who board the Toy Train do so to get the experience and not for any local commute . 

Do Darjeeling and the Toy train More",Jan-19
MEMORABLE JOURNEY BY DARJEELING TOY TRAIN,babunroychowdhury123,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Jan-19,Kuu-jhik-jhik....a sound which paints a picture of serenity and divinity in the minds of people...th enchanting beauty of the hill queen coupled with the beauty of the steam engine led toy train etches a never-fading memory in the mind....though the diesel engine borne train is never any less..the heritage ride which strangles the mind in awe is an experience to savour..indeed a brilliant journey...,Mar-18
Not upto the expectation.,PrabaharPM,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,19-Jan-19,"Very costly. For the money we spends, not giving satisfaction. Its moving in congested road. No scenery other than batasia loop.",Jan-19
Heritage!,delta8488,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,16-Jan-19,It is a heritage experience especially for train enthusiasts. Booking to be done through IRCTC website rather than through agents,Dec-18
Beautiful view of the place through toy train,Pooja_Vikesh,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,11-Jan-19,You couldn’t see the beauty of Darjeeling if you have missed the heritage toy train. I took a round trip ride from Darjeeling till Ghoom. It was such an amazing experience I had it on the toy train. It runs very slow through the narrow lanes. A bit crowded sometimes but you can always adjust if want to have this memorable experience .,Jan-19
Heritage joy ride,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,31-Dec-18,"Well it was so good to have a pleasant joy ride 2042 feet above sea level 
Well maintained trains and good joy ride around 8 KM with a pitstop at Batasia loop kanchenjunga view point",Dec-18
Toy Train Got Cancelled,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,26-Dec-18,It was the worst thing as my toy train got cancelled in the morning and we could not enjoy it. It was really upsetting.,Dec-18
Fun ride,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-Dec-18,Enjoyed the ride and views at slow motion. The difference of fare between disel drive and steam engine drive is a bit high though following the same route.,Dec-18
Disillusioned,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,12-Dec-18,"You may have seen in movies about this romantic ride but it's just like a tram ride in Kolkata, nothing more than that as this goes along with a very crowdy busy road, no off-road scenary can be seen",Mar-18
An experience of its kind,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,6-Dec-18,"Had heard a lot about this Himalayan Toy Train n the opportunity to experience will be etched in memory forever. The slow moving train amidst the traffic, hustling market, monasteries, breathtaking views, all seems like we are in some other part of the world. To add to all this we were in Darjeeling during Diwali and the festival fervour added more charm to all this. Batasia Loop is a beautiful spot to spend some time.",Nov-18
It’s heritage,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,2-Dec-18,"Must do the toy train ride from Darj to Ghoom via Batasia Loop and take pics along the way. 
The mighty hill view of Mt Kanchenjunga will be on your right most time and a morning ride is advised.",Nov-18
Only if u must,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,24-Nov-18,"Its a unique experience to to go for a toy train experience in Darjeeling, a very heritage part of the town. However tickets are expensive if not booked in advance. Short trip from darjeeling to GHUM is enough.",Nov-18
Toy Train in Darjeeling,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,15-Nov-18,Toy train riding is a very good experience in Darjeeling . This train also a heritage of Darjeeling.,Oct-18
Full fun,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,11-Nov-18,Very good place for couple toy train is very enjoyable there are many good places hear. Sun set view is very beautiful,Jun-18
No so enjoying,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,8-Nov-18,We prefer diesel engine joy ride due to excessive fare of steam engine. This ride was not so enjoying except the heritage value. First class Coach was very simple with a yellow bulb was install for lighting. No view during journey except the area of batasia loop.,Oct-18
Utter waste,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,8-Nov-18,"Utter waste, don’t even do this! This piece of shut of just occupying the space and making the city congested! Should be removed and made space for other things. Darjeeling by itself is just people and crowd. with that comes this age old thing which hardly anyone uses. Any say about Bengalis!",Nov-18
Unforgettable Experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,8-Nov-18,Such a wonderful experience we all have that we would like to repeat again and again. The toy train journey remind me the days when used to travel on the narrow gauge trains run by steam engine during our childhood.,May-18
Heritage train,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,7-Nov-18,"Nice toy train passing through the streets of Darjeeling. You can see the town, and folk. The train passes through very close to the local shops, the keepers make way when the train come chugging and whistling. It halts for about 5 minutes in batasia loop and you can get down and take pictures. A memorable ride for kids. 
Tickets can be booked online.",May-18
Nice heritage tour,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,7-Nov-18,"It will feel like floating in the cloud.... 
need to be proud of the highest altitude station in the world",Aug-18
Go for it if you love trains,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,5-Nov-18,"This is a train ride like no other. Noisy, dirty, jerky. But if you are into steam trains you will love it. 
Don’t expect to stick to a timetable because the train makes so many unscheduled stops. Constant repairs, filling up with water are just part of it. 
But it is exciting to be on a train that skims past the local shops that have spilled out onto the pavement. Fun to be on a track that crosses from one side of the road to the other with traffic having to give way at so many places. Annoying to see your clothes being covered by smuts from the belching chimney of the train. Wonderful to be at an altitude of 7000 feet and have the opportunity to see local life as it happens. 
Our photographs are wonderful, the views of the town of Darjeeling, spilling down the hillsides, is unforgettable. 
In conclusion I am glad I did the ride but wouldn’t do it again. It is a unique experience. More",Oct-18
Not worth it!!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,4-Nov-18,"It's a world heritage site!! A matter of pride for us. It's a legacy which we need to preserve and pass on to the next generations. We went for this ride with so much expectations and Bam! Have not been more disappointed in life, ever! First of all, you need to plan this well in advance. You have to purchase the tickets from IRCTC website. And they are so pricy - when we booked we saw it was Rs. 1500 for steam engine and Rs. 800 for diesel engine. Not wanting to spend too much, we opted for the diesel engine. Honestly, it does not make much difference. The steam engine train is only better looking than the latter. Not worth spending so much more for it. Yes the train with the steam engine looks amazing. It also sounds amazing. But that's it! That's the attraction. Go there, take pics and you will be done for the day. If you take the ride, it is for two hours. It will take you through the city roads.

This was not at all enjoyable for us and the worst thing is, it is so terribly maintained ( not really the train but the town as a whole) that you start questioning the world heritage standards. Yes it has a historical significance, but the government really needs to put in their efforts to ensure that this site lives up to people's expectations. More",Nov-18
Worst,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,19-Oct-18,"Strongly suggest to avoid this journey.. 
Not at all maintained... 
Worst .. destroyed my trip... 
It can stop without any reason... 
No luggage space at all.",Oct-18
Heritage But Misery!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,17-Oct-18,"So, it was the last day of our vacations, and me and my friend wanted to enjoy to the fullest. We were coming straight from Gangtok, passing through a breath taking route and our expectations about Darjeeling and toy train were really high. We reached Darjeeling around 2PM and straight away headed towards our Hotel. The whole process of counter booking, bargain and finding a perfect room consumed two hours. I had no craze for the Toy Train but my friend had this unexceptional craving for it. He dragged me to the train station and forced me to buy the tickets. About the tickets, There are two types of tickets 1. Steam Engine - 1310 2. Diesel Engine - 810 To our Good Luck (Good luck cause diesel engine tickets are cheaper and while you are inside the train there is not much of a difference.) steam engine tickets were already sold out, so we opted for Diesel engine tickets. It was a 2 hours long ride and I was quite prepared for it from the start but as I moved inside the train I was discomforted. 2*2 chair seats and that too the narrow ones'. Me and my friend we both are on a bulky side, so it was a bit difficult to fit, But any how we managed and settled down on our seats. The train starts with a very loud honk, that hits your ears quite hard.... So,

There are two types of tickets 
1. Steam Engine - 1310 
2. Diesel Engine - 810 

To our Good Luck (Good luck cause diesel engine tickets are cheaper and while you are inside the train there is not much of a difference.) steam engine tickets were already sold out, so we opted for Diesel engine tickets. It was a 2 hours long ride and I was quite prepared for it from the start but as I moved inside the train I was discomforted. 
2*2 chair seats and that too the narrow ones'. Me and my friend we both are on a bulky side, so it was a bit difficult to fit, But any how we managed and settled down on our seats. 
The train starts with a very loud honk, that hits your ears quite hard. But the excitement of the heritage journey makes you pass everything you kind of dislike. The train began its journey and so the clouds started to shower, my real thoughts at that time was ""Dude, this gonna be fun"" but not actually. 

Our first stop was Batasia Loop located at Hill Cart Road. It is actually a garden, with a war memorial. It was a 10 minutes stop, so we got down the train and started exploring. On any normal day it might have looked boring to me, but that day with slight rain, the garden looked stunning. The clouds and the water, the scenic beauty of the place was marvelous. 

Our second and last stop was Ghum station/Ghum rail museum.It is actually a 30 minutes stop, Though the museum was nice and quite an antique but after 15 minutes it was really tough to be there. I mean 30 minutes were just so much. 

So this is all about the stoppage and visit points.And now about the train route, 
The route of the train is through the heart of the city, and it is actually not that good. As the train continues on its path, 90% of the route is about houses and garbage. Mountains are very few. The route is something you would never appreciate and also the constant honking of the horns is irritable. It is a two hour journey back and fourth and it is quite tiring. 

Note - The joy train ride is okay okay and not that exceptional. Well, when there is nothing to do, you can surely go for it just for the sake of it. 

That's my review of it. More",Oct-18
An interesting if noisy experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,14-Oct-18,"Went downhill in 4x4 from hotel to join the Toy train (just a steam train with small gauge rails), lovely. Another legacy from the British/Scottish occupants. Water pipes running around the hill, source of water for people downhill.Saw the old protestant church, St Andrews, on hill by train station. Stopped at the museum of the TOY Train, a UNESCO site. Person at open window on train at front of train had sooty hair. Engine driver tooting his horn, as it chugged away. Bit noisy for the locals but must bring in some revenue. Lots to see.",Sep-18
Toy Train,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,30-Sep-18,This depends on the weather if its clear or not that's when you will get the clear view of the Kanchenjunga mountains and also if you have the time and want to take the ride of 850/1310 Rs,Sep-18
Just avoid this!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,30-Sep-18,"No point of doing this! Rather spend your day in hotel. There are no views at all. Just a garden stop in between is fine. Otherwise, it goes through polluted and crowded roads. Doesn't seem like a ""joy ride"". Infact the constant horns by the driver gave a headache. Total waste of time and money.",Sep-18
Darjeeling Toy train,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,24-Sep-18,"It is included in the UNESCO World heritage. One of the highest altitude train starts from New Jalpaiguri (Silliguri), It has two class first class and chair class. Chair class is AC.

Enjoy the ride!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,28-Aug-18,"This quaint train can be enjoyed for 2or 7 hours! If the sky is clear the views are amazing.

It will be your memorable journey... which I can genuinely guarantee.... You will never lament.... And by the way don't miss the Ghum museum..... it's unique in this country.... and do take a look through the big binoculars at the Batasia Loop War memorial towards the mighty Kanchenjunga mountains.... a view not to miss if weather permits to do so.,Sep-17

DON'T MISS IT,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,26-Jul-18,"First of all these pictures aren't even close to how exciting this journey is in deed !! 
Nevertheless whenever people hear Darjeeling; definitely Toy Train crosses their mind. It's one of the iconic things that belongs to India. 
During tourist season you have to book the tickets the day before your journey and you have to be lucky enough to have your ticket in your desired time since tourists go crazy for the tickets. 
Luckily we visited Darjeeling during the off season..... which makes booking ticket ten times easier.",Jul-18

Love for ever,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,14-Jul-18,"Journey of this heritage railway began in 1881 and still it is a living legend. We travelled up to Tindharia station from Siliguri Jn. Though train is very slow, I love it so much. From Sukna station journey became enjoyable. Forest and rolling hills are negotiated nicely. Lunch is served in Tindharia station.",Jul-18
Good experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,10-Jul-18,"Now a heritage, journey through the city on the toy train is something not to be missed, but the steam engine smoke is can be uncomfortable at times.",Jun-18
Must do activity,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,8-Jul-18,Heritage railway station with the two types of ride available one with steam engine and one with diesel engine I recommend steam engine as it is very unique ride cost around 1300 rupees per person you can book directly on the same day While visiting a lot of train timing option we took ride on 1220 train will take you to the whom station which is world's highest railway station there is a Museum there you can visit train will stop there for 30 minutes and will return back nice experience,Jul-18
Toytrain darjeeling waste of Money,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,7-Jul-18,Toy train travel from darjeeling to ghoom etc is totally waste of money nd time.. we paid 1300rs for our ticket.. No gud sight seen was seen on whole way.. the train passes between markets nd traffic areas no gud views in between.. our train was koyla train bloody it was polluting the whole gardens markets nd we customers inside the train were coughing badly by koyla pollution.. So please dont waste ur money on any toy trains.. Please save our environment.,Jun-18
Amazing experience from Darjeeling to Ghum station,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,5-Jul-18,"Natural experience from Darjeeling to Ghum station, train route is also amazing. But the road should be maintained well as because of vehicles it moving slow in traffic. If you visit Darjeeling should experience once. Tea gardens, mountain views, clouds, natural beauty will be seen.",Jun-18
Nostalgic trip,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,3-Jul-18,You dont get opportunity of going on a toy train very often that too in beautiful natural surroundings.So we took Darjeeling-Ghoom train ride.It was two hours journey.Trip is very popular with tourists.So book tickets in advance.It stops at Batasia loop and you have time to visit the museum at Ghoom. It is a journey to be experienced when you visit Darjeeling.,May-18
Can be avoided...hyped,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,30-Jun-18,"I took this journey by making an advance booking along with my kids and family around 10 people. 

We were really dissapointed - 

- Hardly any scenic views as most of the route is commercialised you can see shops and dirt all over 
- We took diesel train and it broke down twice. Second time we were stuck for more than 90 minsand decided to abandon the train. Later got to know it is a regular affair. 
- Overpriced and fully commercialised 

Just go to the station and see the engine and train and that should be good enough. 

Anyways whole of Darjeeling is in a bad shape.",Jun-18

Toy Train..a nick name for Mountain Train,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,15-Jun-18,"Nice to ride the train as it is very different from Toy Train of Nilgiris as this is big and goes through not only tunnels, but also through the streets of North Eastern towns and cities across States. Too slow, but fun. One way is good to go and to choose other modes of transport the other way.",Jun-18
Norhing except for heritage value,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,8-Jun-18,"The price for this service is extremely high, especially the steam engine option (~ 1300 per person). The train passes theough the not so clean lanes between Darjeeling and ghoom, which you would anyways watch while coming from airport to Darjeeling city. The train makes lot of noise which is similar to drum beats made in funeral. It's worth a watch for couple of minutes, when train moves in front of you - but not being inside. 

For what ever reason you decide to take this train, choose diesel option (it saves money and makes no experience difference). Tickets can be booked on IRCTC website as well - 2 hours of time in total (Darjeeling to Darjeeling including stops at Batasia loop and railway museum). More",Jun-18
Over hyped and over priced,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,6-Jun-18,"The sad part of this Toy train experience is, even after paying a huge price for the ticket all that you get is to travel beside the roadway. 90% of the railway track for the toy train is next to road way. Hence you do not get any additional view points etc., better not to spend the money unless you want an toy train experience.. Ooty Toy train is much better than this.",Jun-18
Over priced,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,5-Jun-18,"It's a good one time experience but the price you pay is not that worth...I didn't felt anything exceptional about the ride.The train passes through route which are dirty nothing as beautiful scenic view s as such.one thing is the engine releases a lot of smoke ,which creates lot of air pollution.",May-18

A must have experience.,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,28-May-18,"Takes you back in times. To imagine that a train system was built in those times in such a difficult terrain, is a marvel. The fascinating part is when the track criss-crosses the road umpteen times in the city. We took the steam engine ride for the full historical feel (the diesel engine is easier to book because of more frequent trips). Despite the coal ash depositing on the face and in the hair if you pop your head out of the window, enjoyed every moment of it, The scenery, the struggle of the pint-sized engine, are a fond memory.",May-18
City ride in train,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,25-May-18,"Ride through the city filled with fog was ok. Nothing great about it. If we had gone through more scenic places, it would have been better",May-18
Didn't enjoy the ride,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,24-May-18,This train passes through the city which is very filthy. Not something that you like to witness on a holiday. The local health departments need to take a serious note in the upkeep of this beautifully located hill station.,May-18
Wonderful Experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,23-May-18,"It was a nostalgic trip as we took the joy ride of the Darjeeling Toy Train from Darjeeling to Ghoom and Back.

Great activity in Darjeeling,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,21-May-18,"Toy train is a lifetime ride, kids enjoy more. Darjeeling is the place surrounding by tea gardens and mountains or hills which will be covered by toy train ride. Must visit if you are there. I personally took thrice.",May-18
A good choice,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,20-May-18,"The Darjeeling Joy Ride is one of the most talked about activity in the city. It gives one a tour of the city of Darjeeling and gives a chance to witness the oppulent landscapes.

It was only when we reached the station that we got to know that the train doesn't run before 9:30.",Apr-18

Waste of time and money,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,13-May-18,Our scheduled toy train ride was cancelled. We booked almost 3 months in advance and came to know about it when we visited station to board the train. We stood in que and luckily got tickets in a special train with tickets @800 inr per person for a 8 km ride from Darjeeling to ghoom station and back. Noisy train with a blaring horn - we had to shut our ears close as we were seated right behind the engine. It was a foggy day and we could hardly see any valley or mountain views. All we saw were the polluted alleys and buildings of all size all around. Totally avoidable. Ooty ride is much better. More,May-18
Great experience historical train,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,5-May-18,"If you like historical trains then you should definitely book a ticket for the toy steam train. It's a tourist train so don't expect a lo am experience. Still it's fun, comfortable and beautiful. Locals go by the much faster and cheaper jeeps.",May-18
Not worth due to mindless construction that spoils the experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,1-May-18,"The ticket cost is 1200 per head is too expensive, the journey is not that worth. The train passes through crowded markets and you will hardly enjoy the view of the valley or the mountains. its construction everywhere and not even an inch of space is left for enjoying the view from the train. If you want to see the train you can go to Darjeeling station or Batasia or Ghoom and take a closer look at the steam engine. Overall Darjeeling is a crowded over exploited tourist place which is already saturated. This is a classic example of what mindless tourism development can do to a place.",Apr-18
Not worth it,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,28-Apr-18,The whole track runs along crowded roads. Only charm is the steam engine. Darjeeling is bursting at it's seams. Hope the government puts a total ban on new vehicle registration and new construction,Apr-18
Enjoyable ride,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,22-Apr-18,"The train travels from Darjeeling to Ghum on back. It's a nice experience to ride the steam train. Unfortunately due to development, many buildings have come up enroute which block the view of the valley. The musuem at Ghum is worth a visit.",Apr-18
Childhood Memories,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,19-Apr-18,"Darjeeling Toy Train is where the train runs on the road and you can see road and rail transport co exist without a traffic jam or a choke inspite of narrow roads. Traffic sense among the locals is much better as compared to some of the big metro city's of india. 

Worth a experience. But little costly for a 2 our ride",Mar-18
Just like in movies,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,12-Apr-18,The station looks surreal just as if came out of a fantasy movie with many steam engines/toy trains waiting to board the passengers,Mar-18
A to do must in Darjeeling,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,10-Apr-18,"My first trip to Darjeeling started with ride on the toy train. The total trip is for about 2 hours covering a distance of 8 km either ways with stops at batasia loop and Goom station. The batasia loop has a war memorial and beautiful panoramic view of the city. The Goom station has a Rail Museum. 
Tickets for the ride could be purchased at the local railway station at Darjeeling town or it could be booked online through IRCTC. The fares are bit exorbitant though. Rupees 1310 for the steam locomotive and rupees 850 for the diesel engine. In spite of this pretty steep price,tickets are available only a day or two in advance. If you visit Darjeeling a ride by the toy train is a must. More",Apr-18
must try when in Darjeeling,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,3-Apr-18,"Needless to say Darjeeling is famous for this thing. But we didn't take the journey as for 8 km return 400 RS seems pretty much to us.so we went to ghoom by Jeep. A toy train arrived.we hopped on.took some pics & got off.later we check out some old wagons at the Ghum museum. So yeah if you are on tight budget, you can follow this too. Darjeeling to ghum shared Jeep ride takes only 20 rupees from Darjeeling chowrasta.",May-17
Real Fun,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,3-Apr-18,"Train rides for Indians is still a big attraction. However, this experience is very unique in itself. The tickets can be bought online via IRCTC portal. The costod approx INR 1300 for a 2 hour fun ride seems quite steep. But the experience of a steam engine, Travelling in train, right next to the road, takes the imagination back in 19th century, when it all started. Also, when you see 80 percent of visitors on road clicking photos of the moving train, itself speaks a lot of how attractive this is. Besides all the negatives like high cost, noisy engine, pollution of steam an coal particles, my personal opinion is to still go for it if one can afford it. It is worth an experience of a life time. More",Mar-18
Over Hyped,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,28-Mar-18,"The Toy-Train , as the name suggests is tiny and narrow. The Engineering Marvels are the Steam and Diesel Engines - both made in 1940s. You can visit the Darjeeling or Ghoom station to check them out. The train ride is not that great. The route is mostly parallel to the road so the view is no different. But you got to have a look at the train.",Mar-18
Good,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,24-Mar-18,Good himalayan feel while travelling could be more luxurious but covers all parts of Darjeeling nice feeling,Mar-18

Holiday,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,10-Mar-18,"All will love this, we can't think Darjeeling with out the toy train. This gives an identity to the place. Only one issue is the early morning train gets cancelled frequently. I have found that train which starts at 10 AM is regular, booking for this train should be done in advance as otherwise tickets will not be available.",Mar-18
my childhood dream.... but thats just it,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,28-Feb-18,"it was my childhood dream to be on the toy train in darjeeling. we booked a whole trip around it. you are 10 inches away from peoples houses and windows and doors. everything is very unclean outside although the train itself is very clean and beautiful, apart from some sights, most of the way is just the crowded city with a lot of daily smells and noises and just doesnt live upto what we had expected.",Feb-18
One of my favourite thing,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,27-Feb-18,"This toy train is very famous all over the world. You could really enjoy the journey. As the train goes through different types of hill, you could enjoy those different hill at same journey.",Mar-17
Must go at Darjeeling,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,23-Feb-18,This is a simple toy train ride ..but what makes it unique is the history of Himalayan railway attached to it..the tickets have to be pre booked because of the rush.. slightly costly bt worth the experience.The ride is of 2 hours duration and has two stops one at batasia loop and one at ghoom museum..go for it's it's one of it's kind..p.s go for the steam engine not the usual diesel engine.,Feb-18
"If you only have time for one attraction, it is this",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Feb-18,"Went to Darjeeling on solo travel last Nov-Dec of 2017 and it was splendid! 

Apart from my daily walks around town and engaging in interesting conversations with the locals, it is the toy train experience that is the highlight of my trip. It really felt like I was in a Harry Potter scene! 

Tip : 
1) get the steam engine train ride for a more authentic experience 
2) if you are somewhat allergic to smoke, do bring a face mask - it is not air conditioned so the smoke from the steam engine can at times get inside the carriage since the windows are often open",Nov-17
Fun experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,12-Feb-18,Definitely a unique experience that is worth trying out. We took the joyride that takes about 2 hours with a short stop at Ghum where you can also visit the little museum. Fun experience!,Feb-18
Very small route,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,7-Feb-18,"Its running on a very small route, no tunnels no bridges. 

starts from darjeeling drop to ghoom via batista loop(10 minutes halt) 

USP : travel through roads. 

Good time pass for 2 hrs. 

very costly. opt for diesel engine. 

not a excellent ride but a good one 
must try if you visit darjeeling 

don't opt for return journey, ask driver to arrive at ghoom station to save time.",Feb-18
When the Journey beats the destination,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,5-Feb-18,"It was solo trip from Siliguri to Darjeeling on 22nd Jan ‘18. A six hour train journey through the winding hill, along the black winding road, through the hills, the pines, the streams, the curves, the loops, the bridges and the clouds. The awesome direct drop view from the hill tops as the train chugged along the extreme edge of the hills... the real beauty lies before it reaches Kurseong, before the hill towns starts but again Kurseong onwards there is another kind of beauty. And when the train entered Ghoom, you feel the chill and can see the clouds. And finally as it entered Batasia Loop.... you suddenly see the shinning Kunchejangha. And then after so e time the train chugs in to Darjeeling with the Kunchenjhaga shinning from left side of the station. An awesome experience, especially if you love train rides and love the Himalayas. People who do kot love train rides might not enjoy. I just did not realise when the 6 hours had passed by. Bu the time I teached Darjeeling I had taken almost 200 odd photos and many videos on my iphone. Hungry, I got down at Darjeeling, took a cab to hotel, freshened up and went to Keventers to enjoy tea with the setting sun. More",Jan-18
An indelible experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,1-Feb-18,"In this world of electric trains, this train ride will take you into British era, with a green scenery all along the way. I will suggest booking tickets in advice as it is always in demand. Coal train is recommended although it can be slightly expensive. Tickets can be booked online on IRCTC app/website. Totally worth the cash.",Apr-17
"Historical ride through the Darjeeling city, on chuk chuk chuk.....",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,31-Jan-18,"The train ride is an integral part of Darjeeling's history. 
One can see the hard work of the supporting & maintenance staff involved on daily basis for the daily 2-hour trip from (Darjeeling - Ghoom station) 
The train is kept neat and tidy but it's in our hand how to maintain it. 
The government should keep the city clean, at least areas next to the rail track, so the travelers would have a better experience. 

Suggestion: 
One can also drop down at Ghoom station as the journey back is on the same track, so can skip the repeated scenery.",Jan-18
Amazing place to visit,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,30-Jan-18,Darjeeling Toy Train is an amazing place to be visited in Darjeeling. It is a very famous place here. The rides in this toy train will be a wonderful and amazing experience for both adults and kids. The engines are so nice to watch. Very memorable place.,Oct-17
Toy Train of Darjeeling the Queen of Hills,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,17-Jan-18,"Had a Wonderful Experience by travelling in this train, a means of travel of yesteryears. 
The whistle of this train is a Nostalgia. 
Book your tickets well in advance on IRCTC as you may not get them at a short notice, Should experience it. Try to prefer the steam engine though it costs more than the diesel engine.",Apr-17
if you wsih to live in the past you will enjoy the Steam engine ride,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,10-Jan-18,"Part of the Darjelling Himalayan Railway(DHR) is the Highest Railways in India and 22nd in the world. the Joy ride as it is a 2 hour to and fro ride between Darjeeling and Ghum station. The steam engine is the real deal although one can opt for a diesel engine. 
The Tickets can be booked through IRCTC website and also bought directly at the station or by travel agents. 
The cost is 1248 per ticket but no tickets and seat for kids less than 5 years. 
The ride passes through the city and stops at 3 places. 
there are only 2 coaches in the steam engine train so it is better to book in advance. 
the Ghum station has a museum showing various aspects of DHR. 
The Kids do like the ride but adults may not find it very intreguing. 
One does think that the amount of pollution contributed by it worth the ride or not 
If you are travelling in winters adequate warm clothing is recommended More",Jan-18
Optional see : A Step into History and Joy Ride,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,5-Jan-18,"1) Darjeeling railway station is situated near town centre and still has the old station building maintained. As we walk inside, we feel like stepping in side railway history of India. 
2) This is a narrow-gauge railway which goes down towards Bagdogra/New Jalpaiguri. But we have a 2.5 hour return journey available which takes us from Darjeeling to Batasia Loop to Ghum Railway Museum and back. 
3) The tickets are expensive but it is worth for the memorable journey through Darjeeling streets where the train runs along with taxis, cars and pedestrians. It is a hilarious journey indeed. 
4) The Batasia Loop stop has a war memorial worth visiting and the Ghum Railway Museum houses many old photographs & equipment used during construction and use of the railway line in earlier days. Entry is free for these two spots when you travel on this journey. 
5) Overall it was an enjoyable journey and worth to have a peek at the history of Himalayan Railway. More",Oct-17

City ride,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,7-Dec-17,It was very nice experience.you can enjoy the beauty of Darjeeling through the toy train .and the view of Kanchenjunga through this ride.. You can enjoy the view of Batista loop as well,Nov-17
A must do but...,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,6-Dec-17,"It's really expensive, to do the joy ride which is 2 hours to Ghum and back it's R1300 for steam and R800 for diesel. 

I know the cost of upkeep must be phenomenal however the least you should be able to ask for is a non damaged seat. 

However it is a must do and I really enjoyed it.",Dec-17

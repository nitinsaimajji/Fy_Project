Memories!!,Padmini S,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,27-Feb-19,"This is a place I had been to as a child and so when a cousin of mine asked me to accompany her with a group of children I didn't mind.Well I wasn't interested in seeing the animals but was keen to see how other people ,especially children enjoyed. The place was not too crowded, being a weekday I guess. The children went berserk seeing the animals and birds and it gave me a good feeling that all is not lost..as kids today are more interested in mobiles and other gadgets. A good experience altogether!!",Feb-19

Suprisingly neat and attractive,Pradipto R,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,26-Jan-19,"I visited this place after many years, to get my son aquantited with animals which he had seen in books so far. Contrary to the infamous opinion about the lack of cleanliness and dearth of animals, we found this place quite neat and well maintained. Despite covering a big area, the appropriately placed signboards make navigation convenient. Abundant deers, giraffes, peacocks and a wild variety of birds make for a very pleasant trip. Yes there are just a couple of tigers and lions and placed at a more-than-formidable distance, however, that is quite a sight. By the time we finished watching the elephants and were considering looking for the exit, we found it right in front of us. Overall a very pleasant trip. More",Jan-19

Child Memory refreshed,ziniatalks,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,7-Jan-19,"The day was nostalgic. Liked the ease of e-ticketing. 30 per head and 250 with movie camera. The entry gate is separate and no rush. But the lady in the counter did not check our identity, though the instruction says one need to carry id proof; which may be proved to be a lacunae if something serious happens in this day of terrorism. No security check also in this gate. Counter ticket and the entry was full of people. The status and count of the animals - is actually poor, but only because it is a place with one of my best childhood memories, I have marked average. in each cage you have one one animal, like one lonely lioness(no lion), one rhino (without horn), one sloth bear, 2 elephant kids (6 years and 8 years), one Jackal in miserable state, 4-5 crocodiles, 2 - 3 chimpanzees, kangaroos were not mature, 1 jaguar, 1 cheetah, few tigers in enclosed cage (old fashioned), 1 white tiger in the open arena but was sleeping, a couple of deer each of different categories in their concerned open enclosures, 1 hippo(again sleeping like a mass), Few Giraffe,few Zebras, 1 white peacock with it's lady, one peacock with its family..... the collection of birds are really good, but again alone in the cages in most cases(though I am not aware of their habitat, but birds are generally lives in community, so also Lion and Elephant....

Food stalls are there but options are redundant. I do not find the food courts (if they are at all termed so) are hygienic, lot of flies and open foods are sold; so better to carry your own food. though they say it is a plastic free (!) zone, but food stalls are themselves selling juices and lassy in plastic glasses or lab-based thermocol plates! Otherwise small wraps made of ""newspaper"" with the beautiful and colourful newsprints! 

Drinking water again primitive supply system, not dependable. They are selling packaged drinking water of low grade companies. So again be self-reliant. 

Worst part is washrooms. Lot of urine units, half-level doors as they cater to same sex, so you need not to bother for privacy and you can't even lock from in-side (obvious reason is other can see your presence from outside)! Two-three closed doors are there but to be used as latrine and condition is not usable as stools are visible, while urine can't be seen in plain eyes, so you are bound to use the half door ones. Water supply pipe-line is there but no mugs to apply. In short, filthy and no privacy. In the duration of 3 and half hours, I used once, I have not noticed any attendant to clean. My husband's feedback about the male urinals are also same. It's a shame! 

There is no arrangement of any activity for the animals in their enclosures, not outside for the kids (like toy trains, play tools etc). Lots of grounds are there where people are sitting and doing family picnics amidst dust. No cart for carrying aged people, so avoid if you have aged people in the group or expect walking. 

No parking owned by the zoo authority! So avoid personal vehicle. 

In short, in Kolkata, if you do not have to go anywhere and you have never got a scope to experience what a zoo is, come to Calcutta Zoo. Better to avoid. I have been to Darjeeling Zoo, Mysore Zoo, Bangalore Zoo, Vizag Zoo, Delhi Zoo, Nainital Zoo and on top of all Nandan Kanan in Bhubaneshwar; these all are gems of keeping the animals in Captivity. Hope the feedback helps others. More",Jan-19
Old memories....refreshed,Shantanu_s76,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,6-Jan-19,"When I was a kid, I used to visit the Calcutta zoo with my dad, almost every month! The last time was in my high school years in the early '90s. So, it was a trip down the memory lane when I visited the same old zoo again a few days ago....after decades, and was pleasantly surprised to find it the same and well kept. In fact I found it to be a lot cleaner and better maintained than before. The glass covered viewing shelters at the tiger, leopard and kangaroo enclosures, provide an unrestricted view of the magnificent animals....the star attractions undoubtedly being the five bengal tigers (2 white and 3 natural) that we saw. The white tiger made a majestic appearance and leisurely walked past the glass separation a couple of times, could clearly see every movement at a distance of just a few feet. As mentioned before, the entire area is pretty well maintained, especially keeping in mind the kind of footfall it experiences, dotted with snacks/ice-cream counters all around. But I do need to say here that we as a race, need to be better mannered and be conscious about littering. There is an entry fee of Rs. 30/- per head (no time limit) and the zoo keeps open from 9am to 5pm, Friday to Wednesday (closed on Thursday). There are three entrances, the main one being on the Alipore Road. Among the other two entrances,... When I was a kid, I used to visit the Calcutta zoo with my dad, almost every month!

I'd recommend you to visit the website of the zoo beforehand. 
And of course, this is a ""must visit"" for your Calcutta experience to be complete. 
P.S. Avoid taking your own car, severe shortage of parking in and around the zoo. More",Dec-18

One of the famous zoological gardens of India to get in touch of variety of wild animals, numerous number of birds and vegetation.If you manage to go to the zoo even every year, every time you experience a happiness in your mind, not a bit of monotony can touch you. 

My little daughter really enjoyed the real Tiger, Lion, Elephant, Zebra, Deer...and couldn't believed their existence as she used to look them in her books and television until she came to the zoo. 

The zoo is well maintained and staffs are really doing good. You are allowed to carry your own food ,but plastic bags are a big NO. But lack of proper supervision and security check, some people are still carrying plastic bags. I also noticed lots of people throwing plastic cups, ice cream cups, plastic spoons beside and in the main water body. Though there are many washrooms, some stupid parents made their kids to pee beside the path. These type of acts are need to be stopped by strict supervision. More",Dec-18

Frustration was increased because the Zoo otherwise is clean and well maintained. 

Finally, a very nice feature about the Zoo is it gives you the option to adopt an animal. Its a great idea, which not only ensures funding for the Zoo but gives animal lovers the opportunity to care for the animals, albeit, vicariously. I am considering adopting the Slow Loris! More",Oct-18

The zoo is famed for its white tiger and Bengal tiger, but features a number of other indigenous animals, some unknown to people outside India. It also has kangaroos, zebras, and other more standard zoo animals. All animals have large enclosures and are well looked after. There are also a number of exotic trees marked in the park. 

Only Bad thing is that, though Alipur zoo is the oldest zoo in the country but the animals are in such a bad condition no one can understand. Each and every animal enclosure were smelly.The tiger were skinny and not active. Eelephants water pounds were dirty, there were lots of garbage all scattered around. It was very heartbreaking to see our national bird and animal ( tiger & peacock)in such a bad condition.

3) Well laid-out zoo. Trees everywhere and open spaces. 
4) A rule stating there is no plastics or food allowed. HOWEVER there was plastic everywhere, and heaps of families sitting eating with their picnic food in plastic bags, then throwing the polythene bags in the bushes or just on the ground. Hilariously, plastic bottles were being sold inside the zoo at numerous venues , when there were many signs saying plastic bottles were not allowed. 
5) There was rubbish everywhere. Inside enclosures, outside enclosures, everywhere. You'd think, being India's oldest zoo, they'd take a special pridein looking after and keeping the grounds clean. Nope. 
6) Toilets were almost crime scenes. Ladies toilet had used nappies and bloody sanitary napkins stuffed in corners and balanced on top of walls. Absolutely disgusting. And this was right after the zoo had opened for the day, indicating their cleaning rota is pretty shabby.

The ticket price is Rs 30 per person.We were totally berserk and tired when we finally made into the zoo. we paused on one side to have some water. then we started roaming. It was amazing to find the number of people who have poured in to the zo0. The aimals can easily be counted in lieu of the people who were already there and still constantly pouring in. 
We chose one side from which we started to explore the zoo. Outside Each and every cage there is lots of heads one can spot. Its very difficult to spot any animal amass the crowd. One got to literally push one another to get a glimpse of the animal prevalent in the respective enclosures.And there are always some selfie maniacs who, after spotting the crowd is busy taking selfie withthe animal.While pushing our way through the crowd t visit one enclosure my wife got bruised on her left arm. After taking a 2 hr stroll that through amidst a sea of people who decided to return. 
We found theres no sitting place in the adjacent field areas among the zoo as many people brought cooked foods like rice, chicken , biriyani, paranthas, alurdom in dekchis and haris as well as in large tiffin carriers and many more food stuffs as if there was some picnic going on and watching the animals was just a secondary thing. The air was filled with the biriyani and chickens. 
We again wrestled our way towards the exit which took a long time coz of the continous wrestling and paving our way through the midst of the sea of the people and when we returned home we were cmpletely ut of energy, drained and devasted. We felt body aches on the next day as well which persisted for some days.

They use to have a wide selection of Animal, Birds, Reptile etc. But now a days there are not so many varieties to be seen, even the place is not maintained well.",May-17
Excellent place for children,Jessica M,"Calcutta, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,18-Dec-17,"I have visited the zoo a number of times beginning right from my childhood uptil now. The last visit was 2 days ago. While it is an excellent place to take children (and even adults), with a large number of animals... I do need to give some other information, ie, parking. If you are visiting during the any holiday, or a Saturday or Sunday, it's better you take public transportation. There is very limited space for parking around the area... My husband and I were on a bike, trying to find a parking spot nearby... We had to take 2 rounds just to find the bike parking. It's on the footpath opposite, but very few bikes can be parked there... At most, 20 or so. Ditto for cars. 
Other than this, it's a good place for a family picnic as well.... You can carry your own food, sit on the grass or a sheet... And enjoy! There are ice cream stalls all over, and so is drinking water... However, the toilets are best avoided... Go there only if you are in a desperate situation. 
Every time I go, there are changes, and that makes me go back again and again! More",Dec-17
NEVER GO,Minnie-Lupin I,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,16-Dec-17,"I wasn't sure about going and very tentative to begin with but after reading some positive information in the lonely planet, my sister and I decided to go. I was horrified as soon as I arrived. Dirty, tiny, concrete cages, awful conditions that i thought I would never see in my lifetime. 
The Jackal was left in a rusty, smelly cage on his own, surrounded by his own excretion. I can't even begin to describe the sadness in his eyes. 
The Tigers once again kept on their own. One walked back and forward near the exit, ignoring all the gorging visitors. 
The Elephants were in a enclosure which can only be described as front garden, with a massive ditch all around it to ensure they wouldn't escape. 

I won't go on anymore as to how horrific and terrible this zoo was, but please never go, these animals are like prisoners, but hey haven't done anything wrong. More",Nov-17

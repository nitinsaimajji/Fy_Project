Sunrise at Tiger Hill,dushyant_dabhi,"Ahmedabad, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,25-Feb-19,It was a awesome & mind blowing experience to see the sunrise at Kanchanzanga the 3rd highest pick of the world.,Feb-19
Worth the early start and discomfort of the cold,Likesmifood,"Northampton, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Feb-19,"A 4.30 start still didn’t mean we were first to arrive but our guide did make sure his local knowledge gave us the best spot to see the sun rise over Kangchenjunga. The weather was very cold! 4 layers were barely enough to keep out the chill!, and the cloud kept us in suspense almost the whole time we were there. 
Thankfully they cleared on cue and we had the most magnificent views of the mountains. The highlight of our trip to Darjiling.",Feb-19
The best hill,Shubham K,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,22-Feb-19,I see this type of attractive place in the hill I see many of the people visited this type of place.,Aug-18
Disappointing,Ketan P,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,22-Feb-19,This was a disappointing experience for us as we woke up at 03:30 am in the morning and reached tiger hill before sunrise at 05:00am. Unfortunately it was a cloudy day and we could not get a view of the Kanchangunga... Its always advisable to check the weather situation before planning your travel to Tiger Hill,Feb-19
"Don't miss it, worth the early morning rise!",SubhrajyotiC,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Feb-19,You have to reach there by 4AM for the best views. It gets very crowded as its a major attraction for all tourists visiting Darjeeling year round!,Jan-19
Packed but for a reason,cooker3000,"Dublin, Ireland",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,6-Feb-19,"Probably the definitive tourist experience in Darjeeling but you will not be on your own at sunrise. This place gets jammed; the only place I have seen like it at sunrise is Angkor Wat so be warned. If you want to get a good viewing spot you probably want to be here around 4am; wrap up warm though as it's cold up here. 
Is it worth it all the hassle to wake up early and brave the crowds? It definitely is. There is a reason so many come here and you should also see it for yourself.",Oct-18
Hype Created...,Anil R,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,4-Feb-19,I had visited this place in Jan 2019. I would say there is so much hype created about this place. There are several other places in Darjeeling where you can have much better view of Kanchenjunga range.,Jan-19
All roads to Tiger Hills.,Mperor,"Bengaluru, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,2-Feb-19,It is morning 0430 and the hill station is bust with vehicles and tourists. All roads lead to Tiger Hills. A must in the itinerary for seeing the sunrise. The sun rays on the peak Kanchenjunga and the golden view of mountains are awesome.,Dec-18
Unique Experience..,drkakkar,"Chandigarh, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,29-Jan-19,"If kids, take adequate woollens. One has to reach by 4.30am, to get a good place to watch sunrise. As it is in open, can get very cold, hence plan accordingly. 
The sunrise was a humbling experience and one can see nature at its best there. If lucky, Kanchenjunga massif can be seen best from Tiger Hill..",Jan-19
Midas moment of gold,prrateek,"Hyderabad, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,28-Jan-19,"We reached at shivering 4 am to witness the sunrise at 630 as drivers compel u owing to parking concern. The view of golden blessed mountain Kanchenjunga is a spectacle and a Midas moment to behold. The lack of facility, under construction view area with no safety, signage s are currently a big worry as I fell down owing to the half laid concrete and my leg was bad but had no help with even basic facilities",Jan-19
Best start of the day,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,26-Jan-19,This place offers you the best start of the day. You have a complete view of sunrise and it's reflection of beautiful snow clad mountains. However on cloudy days you may not have the view. I am attaching some photos taken during the visit.,Dec-18
Nice place to hangout :) at early morning 5.30am at freezing cold,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Jan-19,This the is lifetime experience if you happen to visit this place at 5.30am in the morning and by around 5.45 to 6.15 you can experience the golden line which forms on the other end of mountain and this Silver mountain will arise in front of you .... There is no words to explain until experienced...,Jan-19
Tiger Hills,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,24-Jan-19,"Tiger Hills are really beautiful place to visit , Once in a life time experience, enjoying sunrise at morning 5 AM at 4 degree Temperature.",Jan-19
A surreal experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Jan-19,By far the highlight of our holiday...just to see the first rays of sunlight on the mighty Kanchenjunga was an unforgettable and priceless experience. Go early at least 2 hours before sunrise to both get a good spot and parking space!!,Jan-19
Morning starts with Sunrise,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,13-Jan-19,"Tiger Hill is located 11kms (6.8 miles) from Darjeeling town and above Ghum. It's the highest point in Darjeeling hills at an altitude of 8482 feet. The best season to see the dazzling snow covered peaks as the sun rises is between November to January. Summer seasons March to April is also a good time. For sunrise, you will need to start by 3:30am in the morning towards the watching tower by trekking to reach the spot by 4.15am. Some taxi drivers will insist that you start even earlier. There is a reason why. As you reach close to the summit, particularly during the high season there would be a long queue of cars. Hundreds of tourists come here every day for the sunrise view during the high season. As a result, you may have to walk uphill quite a bit as your vehicle may be parked much below the top. Peoples are taking position to watch the sunrise & eagerly waiting. Hundreds of cameras & mobiles’ are ready for shooting sunrise scenario. Morning sky, cool down environment & audience. First comes up thin golden rays from the eastern side from where sun will arise, by seeing the rays peoples voice starts. Now Sun starts arising from the back of the mountain with a very red golden sun look like a ball & peoples started chiming & taking photos of the scene.

Remember, if weather permits then you can enjoy the sunrise, weather can change anytime. The fog and the mist play a mystical game here all the time. They can come from nowhere and put a white blanket all around. So no one can guarantee a perfect sunrise view from Tiger Hill or from anywhere in Darjeeling. 

Tourists are able to see the sun after it has risen quite a bit in the sky and not when they want to see it rising over the horizon and spreading its multicolor hue on the snow capped peaks. More",Nov-18
Must see place,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,11-Jan-19,If you want to see a clear view of kanchenjunga from a very high altitude then this place is for you. It’s quite on a very heightened level and great for clicking pictures. It’ll be a photographers paradise if one has some photography skills. Some kinda construction was going on when i visited but still you will get to see the great view of this beautiful hill station. It is crowded in the morning to see the sunrise but it’s worth watching.,Jan-19
This place defines Darjeeling,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,9-Jan-19,This is an amazing place located a little ahead of Darjeeling’s Ghum area. The drive to the place is simply spectacular and it is a must visit to see the view of Kanchenjunga range. A very early morning sunrise time is much recommended. One should ideally reach the place before sunrise to see the spectacular view,Jan-19
The only Thing to visit in Darjeeling,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,8-Jan-19,"This the only best thing in darjeeling ... 
you need to reach there by 5.30 by that time it will be crowded find the best view place and settle there .... if not later it will be crowded and you may miss the view ...",Dec-18
good view of sunrise on Kanchenjunga,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,5-Jan-19,"Once again Kanchenjunga is the highlight of the site as we see a majestic sunrise on the peak in full splendour ... 
As the infra for the place was still being developed in the form of a sitting podium , there still is a lot to be develped to make this attraction easy going for the tourists ... first we have to get up real early for this ... add to it the travel and then the walk up the hill for around 15 mins as the cars and vans start their parking at the base so as to facilitate easy moving out otherwise the jam is very harrowing . 
There is no security at the place not to mention basic amenities like toilets etc ...even for the gents!!!! 
This is truly a test of mans perseverence to see natures splendour in the face of all hardships... recommened to visit however do clothe yourself up well as the temperature dips on this place especially if there is less crowd. More",Dec-18
Breathtaking!!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,3-Jan-19,"If you are holidaying in December, it is best to check the weather forecast before heading out to Tiger Hill as it takes approx. 5 hours from any resort to Tiger Hill and back as one has to leave early to beat the traffic and catch a spot to experience the first sun rays on the Kanchenjunga. We were there on a clear day but it was supremely cold (2 degrees). While we had multiple layers of woolens on us, it was clearly inadequate as the wind chill at that height was nasty!! A thick jacket and a blanket (if one can manage that) is required. In spite of the weather we got great views of the sunrise and the golden hue on the mountain! It was simply breathtaking. My advice is to not focus on taking too many photographs but just admire and soak in the majestic view. Some things are best viewed through the naked eye and not through a camera lens. More",Dec-18
Eye catching sunrise,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,29-Dec-18,Saw them for the first time in my like. I was happy like a kid.. shivering in 2 degree.. please carry enough woollen cloths so that you don’t become ice. There will be a lot of people at the location so take place facing mountains.,Dec-18
Needs major development,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,24-Dec-18,"Though the views are breath taking and the drive quite pleasant, there isn't much to do here especially because there isn't even a single place to sit. There is no washroom close by either. Really needs development given the major tourist pull this place has.",Nov-18
Mind blowing marvellous memorable view,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,22-Dec-18,"What a view we got, I can't forget. It was such a moment that I never want to forget. The top of the mountain peak was covered with ice, when sunlight fell on it,it became little pinkish..that was the perfect view. We were lucky that we could see it clearly.",Nov-18
A nice location to view Kanchanjanga range.,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,21-Dec-18,"Though could not get the view of sunruse early morning, we could enjoy it at aroung 9 am. First time visitor should not miss it.",Dec-18
On the right day - AMAZING,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Dec-18,We followed previous posters advice and went at 10am on a clear day. It was amazing. Spent 2 hours absorbing the scene. Managed to see Everest cleary but were told this is really not a common thing.,Dec-18
shrouded in mist,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,18-Dec-18,We went to Tiger hill by taxi with a plan to walk back to Darjeeling along the old road . The Hill itself wasn't spectacular due to the building work going on there but the walk back down was great and we met a soldier who showed us the old British sanitorium- a piece of history.,Oct-18
Avoid in the mornings,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,16-Dec-18,"The most over-rated place that you can get to in the entire Darjeeling. It’s a hype created by the local tourist bodies. 

Firstly the place has no facilities, none at all. You need to get there early in the morning say around 4.30 to catch a 6 am sunrise - it’s a 40 minutes drive from the centre of the city and there you need to leave by 3.30-3.45. The cab operators are totally undisciplined and they just block the entire road, which means if you reach early you would be the last one to go back. This also means there is no way you can get out of there in case anyone happens to face an emergency situation. 

While up there, you do see a beautiful sunrise as the Kanchanjanga peak reflects beautiful orange glow from the rising sun. However, the point is that you can view this beautiful sunrise from any part of Darjeeling and you don’t have to come all the way to the top of tiger hill for this. 

I would suggest that you see the sunrise from any good spot in the city and probably visit the tiger hul peak during the day time for a beautiful view of the city. More",Dec-18
Good place. Nothing so special to visit in the early hours.,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,15-Dec-18,"Good place to visit during day time. Not sure about early morning visit here. 

Heard that this place is too crowded & freezing cold during that time. So we preferred to visit this place by 10-11 AM. It was a wise decision. No crowd at all. We have seen Mt.Kanchenjunga clearly & a portion of Mt.Everest. 

Yeah. Mt.Everest will be visible from here on a clear day. I was more excited to see Mt.Everest than Mt.Kanchenchunga as we can see Mt.Kanchenjunga from most of the places in Darjeeling city. 

Mt.Kanchenjunga slowly changes its shade (kind of light blue to yellow) slowly when Sun raises. We saw this from our hotel balcony itself. Am not so interested on sunrise. More",Dec-18
Spectacular Views,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,13-Dec-18,"Spectacular spot for sunrise. Definitely crowded, so our taxi couldn't go very far up the hill. That meant we did a fair amount of hiking to get to the top of Tiger Hill. We were lucky to have a very clear day, so the views were breath-taking.",Nov-18
Too many people,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,13-Dec-18,Too many people for one sunrise. Saw the rising sun with 2000 people. Can be managed better by the state government.,Dec-18
Waiting for Sun in Cold morning,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,8-Dec-18,"As early as 4.30 AM There were quite a number people from all walks of life waiting at Tiger Hill before even dawn could emerge there number had already swelled to hundreds. 
So it was a fantastic scene in complete darkness And in November month Sun obliged but before Him it was Kanchenjunga 3rd highest mountain of world that stole the show.There was fascinating thrill and cheering to Kanchenjunga. First view in morning , engulfed with golden pink shades marvelous beauty..",Nov-18
Lost for words to explain about the experience,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,6-Dec-18,"To reach the observatory hill is a daunting task. To wake up in the wee hours, esply if you have kids along and then the short cut through the dark path, just following the people in front of you assured that they too are headed for the same destination. Then finding the right spot. The under-construction building does give opportunity to all to have a clear view. You will soon realise that all this was worth when all of a sudden there is hooting and whistling among the crowd and there glows the Mighty Kanchenzunja with the first rays of the sun. The beauty of the nature's splendour is that sun emerges after its magestic show on the mountain peaks and you don't have to strain your neck as which one to watch, the sunrise or the first rays casting magic spell on the snowclad mountains. 

If you are lucky enough then there are chances that you can spot the Mighty Everest as well, but it depends upon how clear the sky is. 

This is one of key attractions of Darjeeling but one can't miss this for sure More",Nov-18
Good morning,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,5-Dec-18,"So you've to be there by 0515 AM .. usually sunrise is near 6 AM ... however the earlier the go, better for you to capture a nice spot to witness this mesmerizing view.",Nov-18
"Crowded, quite noisie.",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,2-Dec-18,Quite great untisipation for sunrise. At first glimpse of sunrise place becomes noise and and a bit quaotic. A lot of movement. I guess what I'm trying to say if one once to watch sunrise in piece chose another place.,Dec-18
Sunrise view on Kanchenjunga Peak,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,1-Dec-18,Fabulous view of the sunrise on Kanchenjunga Mountain from Tiger Hill. Very early start and plenty of transports going in that direction. If you find yourself in Darjeeling it's worth the early wake up to see this spectacular event. Visited in Oct 2012.,Jan-18
"Wanna have a look at Everest, go for it!!",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,30-Nov-18,Amazing place to be.!!! A very clear view of the kanchenjunga peak and the ranges from very close.and it makes for a beautiful view!!! And the view of Everest from quite far (of course). However was told by the local people that October end wud b perfect time to see Everest and sunrise very clearly too.,Nov-18
What a View.....,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,30-Nov-18,"We didn't visit in the morning as view from our accommodation in Darjeeling was just awesome..... 

We visited in the afternoon and it was just beautiful. There was no one but only our group.... 

Presently construction of viewing podium is in progress .... doesn't look like will be completed soon... 

Presently",Oct-18
Cream of the Crop,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,25-Nov-18,We had to leave at 4 am to travel to Tiger Hill to witness the sunrise. Well worth the sacrifice of sleep for the amazing atmosphere with thousands of visitors converging on one hill. The drive to Tiger Hill is awesome. A Must see trip.,Oct-18
Tiger Hill nice but... very crowded,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,25-Nov-18,The view and place was so awesome however the places is very very crowded.....suggestion go early and stand at proper place from where you can see both Sunrise and Kanchanjunga...,Nov-18
NOT SO GREAT!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,24-Nov-18,"Wouldnt recommend it anymore. Lots of people, and having to wake up early in the morning. Not worth it. Better to see the sunrise from the viewpoint from the mall. We were lucky to stay at Little Tibet. We walked 100 metres at around 4:30 am and enjoyed the view.",Oct-18
A must visit place at Darjeeling on a clear sky day.,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,20-Nov-18,"A place on a hill top,around 30 km from Darjeeling and at a height of around 8500 ft.One must start from Darjeeling around 4 am to get a better position at the hill top for the majestic view of Kanchenjunga and Sun rise here. 
One big glass house is now coming up,once completed,it will be worth for public to seat and watch both Sunrise and glittering Kanchenjunga,the beauty of Nature.",Oct-18
"Extremely crowded, not worth the time",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,19-Nov-18,"This place was no less than a crowded market. Everyone pushing and shoving, blocking the views. It was an unpleasant experience for us. There are better places in Darjeeling where you'd be able to see the sunrise in a more peaceful and civil manner. You have to get there by 4am because of all the traffic, and then you get stuck for hours trying to get out. If you've never seen a mountain, then maybe it would be worth it, but for me, this was an extremely annoying experience, and a waste of time and money.",Nov-18
Spectacular View,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,18-Nov-18,"... if it wasn’t so crowded. Wake up at 3:30 in the morning to go there in a procession of never ending cars. Thousands of people watch the sunrise on the Kangchenjunga, third highest mountain.",Nov-18
Great Views (If you r lucky),,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,17-Nov-18,"The tour guys will make you reach this place around 4-am, so that you get standing place at the top and they get parking place coz that place gets chaotic by 6-7am. Sunrise is around 5.45-ish. So be ready to stand long, be pushed around and more chaos once the sunrises. If you are lucky and there’s no cloud/ fog cover than you get a beautiful view of Mt.Kanchenjunga. The place could be well organised with some some good toilet facilities make it world class.",Nov-18
Just stunning views,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,15-Nov-18,"Watching the sun rise here is something I’ll remember forever. You get to watch the sky go a gradual rainbow colour as it gets closer to dawn, get to see the sun appear (and everyone cheer) and then once it’s risen get to see the peaks of Kanchenjunga. Just make sure you do it on a day that’s going to be clear. 

It’s a must if you’re visiting Darjeeling and is well worth the very early wake up. We got there for 3.30am and it was already filling up. 

It is very cold though (even for an Englishman) so take a thick coat, hat, scarf and gloves. Taxis can’t get very close as it’s quite busy so bring a torch and be prepared to walk ten minutes up hill in the dark. More",Nov-18
Good Place,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,14-Nov-18,It is a very popular place in Darjeeling to see Sunrise in the morning.The hill looks very nice when sun rising start.,Oct-18
Good place with poor facilities,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,13-Nov-18,"One of the most hyped place in Darjeeling.The major attraction is to see the sunrise and mountain view. One needs to start very early around 3:30 AM to avoid the traffic jam ( it is indeed very bad as 1000+ taxis clog the complete way ).Hence be mindful of starting early in the morning. 
The place is really badly maintained. no proper place to sit and watch sunrise for thousands of people . Can't understand why govt can not complete the half finished stand urgently ( locals tell it is under construction for last 2 years) 

Some tips 

1) Wear warm clothes as the place is too windy in the early morning and you'll have to stand for almost 1.5 hrs waiting for sunrise 
2) Occupy some space in half complete stand .You can get good view from there . Normally the last comers do that but you'll realise that sitting on stairs will give you much comfort and better view . 
3) No toilets at the place . Hence be prepared for it 
4) Club some other places with this as you'll finish it by 6:30 AM More",Nov-18
fabulous views,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,12-Nov-18,"Have to get up early to get a good site at the top of the hill. We left Mayfair at 3:45AM, and were not the first people to arrive. It was cold and windy at the top until well after sunrise, but the view was magnificent! Kanchenjunga is well lit up before the sun comes up! The mountain has sun 20 minutes before Tiger Hill!",Oct-18
Over hyped and no proper arrangement,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,11-Nov-18,"This place is a very over hyped tourist destination. It is good to watch sunrise, but we could not even see Mount Kanchenjunga after taking all efforts to leave at 4 am. 

They are constructing an observatory, but with the sea of visitors coming to watch sunrise and the rays that are supposed to fall on Mt Kanchenjunga, the place is ill equipped to handle the visitors. 

There is no proper provision for parking of vehicles and it is a nightmare to return back after the sunrise. 

Would not recommend to get up at 3.30 in the morning and shiver in the cold weather and come disappointed as luck plays a major part if you can see Kanchenjunga. More",Nov-18
Perfect view point for Kanchanjangha!!!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,8-Nov-18,"Tiger hill itself is a beautiful place as well as an excellent point to catch the beautiful view of the highest mountain peak of India ""The Kanchanjangha""",May-18
Awesome view of the Kanchenjuga,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,6-Nov-18,"It's a cold and freezing vigil from 430 am to 615 am... but totally worth it. 

The November 1st week temperature was around 7degrees, and with a strong wind and fog, the wait definitely was chilly! 

Our driver had warned us that wind and fog would play a major role in being able to see the peaks. They certainly did, causing the Kanchenjuga view to play hide and seek as the sun rose..in the 30 minutes after sunrise, we managed to steal glimpses of the peaks in the changing color of pure white to Golden as the rising sun rays hit them, but these glimpses were enough to make this my top experience of our 5 day Gangtok Darjeeling holiday. More",Nov-18
The best thing to do in Darjeeling!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,4-Nov-18,"We had to leave our hotel at 4AM to ensure we reach in time to Tiger hills for sunrise. Once you reach the spot, you will have to walk for about 10 to 15 minutes to reach the viewing area. 

There is a big open space and also they have built a specific viewing area. I suggest you to go early and get a good place to stand and take photographs. 

Towards the right is the sunrise spot and towards the left, is where you will see the Kunchenjunga peaks. The beauty of this sunrise is that the first rays of the sun fall on Kunchenjunga and you will see them turn a beautiful golden colour. After a while you will see the beautiful ball of light peeping out slowly from the right. It's so beautiful. This is something you have to witness. 

However we also heard that the sunrise is not visible many a times due to the foggy weather there. So please check on the weather updates before you decide to go. 

This place has a small shop if you need coffee or snacks and also has toilets. 

Skip the toy train but do not skip this beautiful sunrise. More",Oct-18
Sunrise,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,1-Nov-18,Great view of sunrise. Couldn't get a glimpse of Mt. Everest as promised. Pretty chilly in the morning. New concrete structures being built now to turn this place more touristy.,Oct-18
Amazing view of the Kanchanganga,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,28-Oct-18,"Tiger hill is not just a sight seeing point it is an experience. Waking up early in the morning by 4am to catch a glimpse of the sunrise and the first beams of the sun falling on the mighty snow capped Himalayas. With people clapping and whistling as the sun rises, this us nothing short of a memorable experience",Oct-18
Amazing view of Kanchenjunga,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,28-Oct-18,"You can get the view of kanchenjunga from here at the sunrise. You should reach here not later than 4am. The rays of the sun directly falls on the kanchenjunga and the view is just amazing. If you're in Daarjeeling, you should definitely take the pain of waking up at 3am and march to the tiger hill. The local cab can be booked in advance.",Oct-18
"Tiger Hill, Darjeeling Overview",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,18-Oct-18,"Lying at an altitude of 2590 meters and a distance of 13 kilometres away from the Darjeeling, Tiger Hill is most famous for its splendid sights of the morning sunrise from where you can see the peaks of Kanchenjunga illuminate before the sun is seen at lower elevations. The magnificent view of snow - capped mountains sitting amidst cotton clouds attracts tourists to Tiger Hill from all over the country. Interestingly, this is also the summit of Ghoom, which is the highest railway station in the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 
This vista point of Tiger Hill is a pristine natural beauty where you can enjoy the virgin charm of Darjeeling in its most endearing form. At sunrise, the peaks of Kangchenjunga are illuminated before the sun is seen anywhere else in the city, which is an amazing thing to experience. Another notable thing of beauty here is the pristine natural beauty of Tiger Hill, which is enveloped in gentle verdant foliage coupled with sublime clouds in the background. The fresh morning air as you make your way to the summit is a refreshing experience away from the banter of city life. More",Aug-18
Beautiful and busy,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,16-Oct-18,Tiger hill is beautiful and worth getting up early for. It was busier than we expected but I would still recommend it.,Sep-18
superb,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,15-Oct-18,Nice place to see the sunrise.Go early for sunrise but depend on whether is cloudy and rainy cant see sunrise,Mar-18
Excellant,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,13-Oct-18,THE place to go to view sunrise over Kanchenjunga. Of course it is weather dependant but on a cloud free early morning you are treated to some stunning views. It's all over too quick though..!!,Oct-18
Best place in Darjeeling,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,12-Oct-18,"What a sight to behold!! Lifetime experience. When the sun rises and its first ray falls on the peak of Kanchenjunga mountain, it is a sight which you can't see anywhere else, I believe. Must Must see if you are visiting Darjeeling.",Oct-18
Lovely sunrise view,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,11-Oct-18,Nice place to see the sunrise. Have to reach here by 5am to see the 5.30am sunrise. IF there are too many clouds then sunrise wont be visible.,Oct-18
Awesome view...,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,10-Oct-18,You can see golden kanchanjunga at the time of sunrise (if the weather is clear). U can actually feel that u are above the clouds..,Oct-18
Breathtaking views,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,8-Oct-18,"We started around 4 from our hotel and we could reach within 30min. It was awesome drive and not many cars were there when we reached the place and we had walk very little distance. The sky was clear and full of stars. The horizon on east was little red. Local people were selling hot tea, coffee and woollen caps, shawl etc. Slowly we could see Kanchenjunga and east sky was brighter now and the color of Kanchenjenga started turning red. All of a sudden around 5:30, the first ray of sun came out from east and within a min sun came out very fast. It was a mesmerizing scene. Kanchenga was looking so beautiful. More",Oct-18

Sun Rise ?? At Tiger Hill ?? . ....,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,4-Oct-18,"One of the best attraction of Darjeeling tour is Tiger Hill. To experience sunrise & golden view of Kanchenjunga, you have to reach too early (around 4am) at Tiger Hill. The weather is too cold so heavy woolen costume is mandatory. It's a speechless & ultimate experience for us...",Oct-18
Breathtaking Beauty,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,3-Oct-18,"The beauty is beyoud imagination. The first thing on to do list of Darjeeling. Rarely do you come across such natural opulence. 

The view that made me reflect, how beautiful is this world that we are living in ans how greatful should we be to live here. Also, we have always underestimated the beauty that India stores in its lap. We run to the foriegn shores to explore the nature. I truly feel that a lot of us have ignored the Seven Sisters that we have. It's time now that we reach out and love them more. 

The radiant rising sun on the carpet of clouds and the peaking Kanchunjunga Mountain Range out of that heavenly sight is an unparallel to any other sight in India. 

A picture speaks a thousand words so I ma attaching some breathtaking images of what amazed me. More",Oct-18
Nature at its best,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,3-Oct-18,"High peaks, natural surroundings, green mountains, clouds, sunrise moment, name it and you will find it. Such is the place, such is the beauty. Must visit.",Sep-18
Rise to the sunrise,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,24-Sep-18,"Tiger hill, the very hyper place can be visited only when there is no cloud, which is very rare as the place is always covered with a layer of white blanket. Try to go in the right season to avoid fog and mist. You need to start by 4:30 am max to witness the sunrise and see the Kanchenjunga. It would take approx. 30 mins to reach the point. Be prepared to walk uphill to the top (another 20 mins walk). From the top, you can see magnificent view.Do remember to wear warm cloths, as it be would be quite cold up there. Girls are recommended not to wear heels as it would be difficult to walk through. More",Sep-18
Perfect,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,23-Sep-18,"I went to Tiger Hill.

It is great place to go.",Sep-18
Kanchan janga sunrise,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,22-Sep-18,Beautiful Kanchan janga at sunrise. Must see at morning. Golden looking mountain is amazing must see view.,Sep-18
Heavenly!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Sep-18,"A dawn visit to Tiger Hill is a must for any Darjeeling trip. We were incredibly lucky as the clouds had cleared just the previous night. The view of Kanchanjunga as the dawn breaks is heavenly. We also saw Everest but it's quite small being far away. 

The downer is the unfinished viewing building. It is positively dangerous as there are no railings and there is debris lying everywhere. There is also very poor traffic management and very little parking space. The govt needs to provide better facilities in one of the most spectacular tourist attractions in India.",Sep-18
Foggy view in Sep,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,16-Sep-18,"The Tiger Hill is usually highlighted by all the tour/travel operators as an early morning visit (4am) to view the sunrise. 
But, please note the weather conditions before going as during monsoon season, there is a foggy view and you would not be able to see anything. It would be a complete waste of time waking up at 4 am to go there, You may visit the place as part of the other sightseeing points itself. 
We visited in Sep and not able to get a view of the sunrise or the view of Kanchenjunga.Currently, the place is even more messier as construction of an observatory is going on.",Sep-18
Chillllly place,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,11-Sep-18,"Be sure to be there by 4.30 am to view sunrise,a remarkable place and dont forget to take your warm clothes as the weather is more cool, If you are a winter lover then you dont need any warm clothes",Jul-18

Great view of Sunrise...but poor infrastructure and no regulation !!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,21-Aug-18,"Tiger Hill is a very popular point to view the sunrise among the majestic Himalayas in Darjeeling. The sunrise was around 4.57 AM and one has to leave Darjeeling by 4 am to catch the sunrise. The roads are poor and the traffic management is absolutely nil. In peak tourist season like May, you may have to walk more than 1.5 km from the parking spot due to the rush, The actual viewing spot itself is in bad shape with broken railings and garbage all around. There is no control on the crowds and it can be really frustrating if you want to have a personal pic. the Sunrise event was a great scene and to see the Sun coming out as a small peck and grow into a full circle was a brilliant viewing experience !! However, it started raining soon and then due to the traffic mismanagement we were stuck there for 45 min. Go if you have patience to view the sunrise in spite of poor infra ... More",May-18
Sun rise point,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,15-Aug-18,We were rather unfortunate as we could not see proper sunrise due to clouds.Later understood it is the situation on most of the days.U need to reach there by 5 30 to get a best place.But unfortunately this place is least developed inspite of its popularity.A nice pavilion can be built for people to comfortably sit and enjoy the sunrise.,Sep-17
sun set and sun rise view point,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,14-Aug-18,"you will feel close to god and your memories will be imprinted with clouds , hills , snow , sun set and sun rise for ever",Sep-17
Not Recommended!!!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,1-Aug-18,"It was heartbreaking to see such a popular and top listed places in Darjeeling in such a bad condition. 

- No proper Management, No sign Boards 
- No way to reach to actual view point 
- Tea/Coffee Vendors catches you and they divert you to different places, where there is no safety railings. They will make you buy coffee even if you say NO multiple times. If you refuse, they pass mean comments. 
- Not recommended for elderly people as the tourist vehicles park really far from the view point.",Jun-18
Breathtaking!!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,28-Jul-18,"Reach as early as possible to get a good spot as people start coming way before sunrise. But if the weather is clear, the view is just mesmerizing.",Jun-18
Just Amazing,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,26-Jul-18,"First rays of sun falling on Tiger hill that sight is beyond words its surreal. With every falling ray snow covered mountain changes color from Red, Orange ,off-white and at the same time sun coming out from mountains like a beautiful bright color ball that spreads beautiful light and positive energy. 

The road to hill is very small and mornings are really chaotic with thousands of tourists visiting in Txais. No proper stands for taxis no other mode of commute . 

There is no observatory deck and hence to get clear view you need to be there early so that you can catch glimpse of rising sun. There was some construction going on which locals informed is observatory deck . Not sure if that's ready yet . 

Mornings are really really cold as you would expect near Himalayan range . So if you plan to visit in winters or early summer ensure you have put on .enough warm clothes . More",Jan-18

Total waste of time and early wakeup,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,3-Jul-18,Darjeeling doesn't have much attraction so Tiger point is one the point where every tour and travel person wants you to send you. This point is also known as Sun rise point. To see Sun rise you'll have to leave your hotel between 4 AM to 4:30 AM so that you can reach there by 5:30 AM to see the sunrise. But most of the time (infact any month) due to heavy clouds you won't be able to see the Sun. Also major problem at this place. In returning you'll have to waste atleast 1-2 hrs in traffic jam as it is one way road so you won't be able to go down until the road is clear from below on hill. Many of my friends visited that place and no one was able to see the Sun. So if you love your sleep you can skip this :) More,Jul-18

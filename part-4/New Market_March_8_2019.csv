Legend has it that if one is looking for tiger's milk it is only to be found in New Market. But if your needs are mundane, here is the list (approximate) of the things you can buy there 

Clothes 
a) .Men's suits to kurta pajamas to tee shirts...Lindsay street on the side facing the clock tower is the place to go to. They have places for bespoke suits too which are quite cheap but tailoring standards are fantastic. 
b)Women's clothes....almost every shop sells them...Indian, Western, party-ware, everyday ware, office-clothes, underclothes, boho-chic...they have everything! And this is the place to buy silk fabric if you cannot handle a sari 
c) Children’s clothes are aplenty ranging from the cheap in every sense of the term to the outrageously expensive and everything in between 
d) Jewellery: Silver, semi precious stones, Tibetan, junk Chamba Lama is the most famous one but there are lots of others with a wide variety 
e) Crockery 
f)Kitchen tools and gadgets 
g) Craft supplies at Yakoob Ali and sons 
f) Perfume: the genuine ones...the sellers are very old and reputed. 
h) Food...ice cream and cake making supplies....all the basic ingredients...chocolate, cream, preservatives, stabilisers, cocoa, whipped cream, treacle, golden syrup, fondant, chocolate chips...most of these things aren’t easily available in Indian Markets. 
i)Dry fruits sold loose, in bulk and in small amounts....here it is much cheaper than anywhere else 
j) Shoes: Mainly shops owned by Chinese settlers in Kolkata. Those used to be very comfortable once upon a time but wouldn’t really recommend it now. Some high value Indian brands on Lindsay street are much better but you can buy a pair seeing how cheap it is. 
k) Flowers: There is a whole line of sellers making up bouquets and wreaths on the spot. They also send these abroad on payment of a fee if you want to send flowers to your loved ones abroad. 
However, be prepared to bargain, haggle, argue with all shopkeepers. That’s a given. If all that work makes you hungry and thirsty stop at Nahoum’s (the city’s oldest pastry shop) for their brownies and marzipan and baklavas...don’t eat the savouries, more often than not those don’t agree with the stomach! Besides, there is Nizam’s and Badshah and Friend’s club for Indian fast food. If your pockets permit, then pop into The Oberoi Grand which is just a 50 metre walk away, for lunch and tea More",Sep-16

Everything appeared so unreal.It was a manor house looking building coined from ancient Europe. Dimly lit alleys with vista of well-lit showrooms ranging from garments to raw vegetables were simply astounding for that age. In my childhood chicken was a taboo in our household. When I visited the poultry section I was enthralled with colorful and bizarre birds like turkey, Koel and let alone dazzling country chickens particularly cocks with large combs in their head. I was under the impression that those birds were sold as pet. Later I understood wonderful cuisines are made from these birds.Birds like canary and other songbirds were also sold in another enclosure. 
Yesterday I chanced to visit Hogg market once more. I visited Nahom Bakery stall and tasted couple of mouth watering pastries, which was a favorite of mine . Things have remained same as before. Only the entrance has been renovated and widened. I chanced to visit the fish section of the market. Fishes of different variety, mackerels, sardines, pomphrets, king size lobsters and 40 kg Vetkis were on display. I have never witnessed a fish ( I mean marine vetki) of such size and shape.

Hogg Market noteworthy for seemingly never ending rows of shop after shop of bolts of sari and salwar kameez fabrics - a riot of colours and textures. 

Ignore touts seeking to help you - brushing them off with a simple but firm ""lagbe na"" (""no need"" in Bengali or Bangla pronounced log-bay nah) usually works as they are taken aback that you might know their language which then also implies you've been around the block and thus can't be readily cheated.

This is traditional local shopping at its best,ddna,Leicester,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,8-Apr-16,"For once I am going to give a local's view. As a bengali I grew up with New Market-the bustling corridors, no frills display of stacked up goods and shops which had done business for generations. As a child New Market was the only shopping complex I knew of, long before the days of sparkling multistories modern tills. This was the place for birthday gifts, festivals, the special occasions.....Followed up with street food in the vicinity-the perfect day out. 
If I remember correctly, the came Treasure Island in the vicinity, then a part of New Market burnt down to be replaced by New New Market(or notun new market as people call it). In the last decade the malls have had their boom but New Market stills goes strong. 
I particularly love Nahoum's cake shop with its old style dark wooden counters, Bombay silk stores for saris, having a drink near the centre with the canon on display. 
Go early as the shops open for business. You can bargain hard. The shopkeepers have a superstition-the first customer is not to be turned away at any cost. 
No visit back home is complete without a New Market shopping spree More",Oct-15

Soul draining experience,Xen0ph0n,London,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,21-Jan-16,"This was my 4th time visting New Market. It was also the 3rd time, the exact same ""official"" guide found me on the same spot near one of the entrances to the market and insisted on taking me to a ""antique shop"". Followed by another 4 other antique shops... always the same ones. As I was in hurry to sort out some gifts I didn't resist but it turned out to be a waste of time. I did find some good shops afterwards where the shop keepers were not too pushy and did start the negotiation with ridiculously high prices. You might want to head straight there. It's the shops which are at the front of the Oberoi Grand hotel. 
The market in general is quite impressive. If you are not Indian you will get a lot of attention as they obviously think that they will get much higher margins from you so it's best to visit with a local friend. Once they figure out one or two things that might interest you, the word spreads quickly and all the shop keepers try to pull you in to show you what they have. More",Jan-16

Don't get me wrong its very interesting, fascinating in its size and density. But often it is overwhelming. It would be hard to overlook the haggling you go through. Watch out, especially if you are from the west. Many times I was approached by shop owners who spoke very good English that wanted to take me to their shop. If you go along, get ready. You're in for a fight over prices. Often they'll show you beautiful things...more than you could ever want. Then write out an itemized list with prices being in the thousands of rupees. Even after getting the shop keep down to 60-70% of his asking price you still feel a bit forced, and they won't take no for an answer. Best not to hang out with any mysterious English speakers here.

Today the place huge and a one stop shop for Bengali people. Festive shopping is almost incomplete if not been to New Market. The place sees a huge footfall during Christmas and New Year as several people rush to grab their plum cakes from Nahoum bakery, one of the finest bakeries in Kolkata situated in New Market. 

New Market has undergone several renovations especially after the two devastating fires that took place in the complex. New Market now has a marble flooring, an automated underground parking system and several other facilities.

The new market gets very crowded in the evening as there are food stalls and other stalls are set up close to the entrance. I've never seen so many people in a place at a time. You'll find cars and bikes trying to pass through crowds and honking furiously. The chaos and noise levels are unforgiving. It's impossible to manoeuver through the crowd if you are not used to it. You will inevitably find yourself in very close proximity with people. Perhaps it's the season, but I found myself on a few occasions next to someone coughing or sneezing.

In the market you can buy pretty much anything including live animals, any kind of stationery, gifts, meat and veg. The wet market is smelly but a joy.

In the eggs bit there are more eggs than I've ever seen. 
I had a haircut and shave in a little booth near the wet market. The barber had a lazy eye but did a great job. I could smell decay and worried at first it was the water he was using. Then I thought it the fact that his paan stained teeth were rotting in his mouth. On remembering that I had tummy meds with me from Aus and could get anything else I needed at a local pharmacy anyway I cared less. It was only while wandering as I waited for my boyfriend to have his shave that I realised it was just fragrant coz I was next to the meat market. Anyway I paid the going rate which is 90 rupees for a cut n shave with face massage. I gave 100. My face was smooth as a baby but it still wasn't as good as the joint I went to in Kanyakamuri. Read my review about that elsewhere. 
Then go off into the streets around the market to eat Kathi rolls. Kofta rolls and those lovely little gram flour snacks hit from a wok burning vendor with a wagon in the street. Get the chilli sauce. Yum. Hot fresh and delicious. I also love the cumin fried chick peas. They come in paper packets made of newspaper.

- everyone wants to convince you into buying no matter what product at least double the prize it's worth- if not more 
- they harass you! There's self appointed tour guides around that ow you no matter where you go and it doesn't help telling them no, ignore them, be mad at them, be friendly. It's very exhausting and rude and I had several really really bad experiences. Be careful they want money. Also they watch what kind of money you have with you And where you're going (which was especially bad in my case since I lived right by new market and then those ""tour guides"" actually waited for me in front of my hotel in the morning). 
- it smells so bad it's incredible. It's unbelievably dirty, there's animal feces and human urine everywhere, rotten food, actual animals (as in dogs and cows and sheep- since its an actual market trade hall), homeless people, etc. 
-lots of beggars- be aware! 
- ""fixed prices"" aren't actually fixed, they just introduce another western cultivation to make us believe it's okay to not bargain their horrific price 
- just because sites are inside the market doesn't mean they're more genuine than outside! 

Nevertheless it's definitely a must go and see place in Kolkata! Don't take too much money, the prices (no matter if genuine or not) are still very low and it's addicting to buy beautiful Indian arts and handicrafts! 

One more piece of advice: if you go here by taxi, tell them ""sudder street"" as your destination since try usually just drop you in a back alley to new market which is usually not very nice, or safe, and hard to navigate to the midst of happening. Both metro stations park street and esplanade are not too far to walk (10 mins)- I prefer park street since walking from park street to new market has nice shops too!! :)

Bargainer's Paradise,Sachin0408,"Mumbai, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,25-May-15,"This massive structure was built during the British Raj primarily to cater to the English crowd. With the passage of time the Market evolved to absorb vast portions of Lindsay Street, Tirretti Bazaar and even Dalhousie square. A fire burned down large portions of the original building on December 13, 1985. It has since been rebuilt, and provided with a new wing. Another fire broke out on July 20, 2011 but was confined to a small area in the Flower Range near the Lindsay Street entrance. 

Now let’s come to the essence of this market – Shopping! It’s a wonderful place for shoppers, items are available at throw away prices and you need to be good at bargaining to strike out a good deal. Those belonging to the pre Independence era would swear by the old world charm of Nahoum & Sons (for bakery and confectionary) Dayaram & Co.(for saris) Bombay Silk House and Ghanashyam (for clothing and dress materials) A. Bose Pvt. Ltd. and Coondoo Florists (for wide variety of flowers).

Hint: you can use the annoying men offering to be your tour guide to your advantage. Tell them what you're looking for (wall hangings, silk scarves, carvings) and they'll take you right there, although they'll be waiting outside the shop for their commission after you leave!

So I ended up quite unexpectedly grateful for the presence of the quiet guide and started following him. That finally shut up the pushy guy. Of course I am sure that my guide took me to shops where he gets a commission on whatever I bought, but he never tried to talk me into buying anything, and by observations learned what I was interested in, and took me to other shops with those types of goods. 

Overall, the experience was fun, and if I had wanted to find lots of gifts and souvenirs, this market would have provided them all, and more. I ended up bargaining for some shawls in a few different places, and buying them at 25% lower than the original asking price. I doubt that my bargaining is good and an experienced Indian haggler would surely have gotten them at 40% off or less. But I still felt proud of myself and had fun. More",Feb-15

You need a few hours to go through the place. Not just the market itself, but the surrounding streets, where the commerce seems to spill out in every direction. Everything is very colourful and super noisy. 

The downside is that visitors who are visibly foreign will be followed by touts, and as much as you tell them that you aren't interested in their goods, they will continue to follow. Pay little attention to them and they will leave you eventually.

But on the same side it can be a shoppers paradise as will get a lot of stuff and if you know the right price and know how to bargain. It is not my cup of tea, and that was the reason why I let the other group members do their shopping there. I would not recommend it to any westerner, but all my kolkata locals enjoyed the place. Some advice - keep a watchful eye on your belongings. If a guy follows you just make it immediatel y clear to him you dont like it and he wont make any money with you. For the bargaining - I found throughout the stalls the started with a price 3x higher than what they should charge. You can easily settle for half, if you want a third it gets really tricky. So I am guessing if you are westerners only the starting price will even be much higher (5x?).

It is a vast market place with shops ranging from flowers to apparels, from cakes and confectioneries to leather items,etc etc, 

Just before Christmas, is the time to go as all the shops are decorated including the market,but one can go any time of the year to experience it though.

Though it is now crying out for some rennovation. I would call it the first super market in India where you could get all kinds of stuff in one place. However, like most good things in the city this too has undergone a change for the worse. Not at all a place where one could take guests if they are foreigners as they would be constantly pestered by locals and beggers and ruin what could have been an interesting outing for them. Also, stay away if you can not bargain hard and then you would be sure to get ripped off!!! Only if one could sestitise the shop keepers a bit this place could be such a rewarding experience for all.

On top of this, the perpetual hassle, the rip-off merchants and the very real safety risks make this a place to visit only if you really want to experience deep, primordial rage.

Unfortunately, we didn't get there until our last day, but I would certainly have returned. If you are interested in nicely priced jewelry, go to the New Market and find Chamba Lama (F58-60). She's a fabulous Nepalese woman, whose shop includes a wide range from very inexpensive jewelry to strings of ruby and emerald beads. She has a lot of silver. I bought ruby and emerald necklaces, and double checked the prices in New Delhi for the same items. Chamba Lama gave us GREAT prices by comparison.",Jan-12

You might need a guide...,max4u,"Yangon (Rangoon), Myanmar",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,5-Dec-11,"Though you are told the shops open at 10 am, you soon realise that most of them do it later.

the Pros: 
1) Vibrant Market 
2) Great for street photography 
3) mouth watering street side foods 
4) old world charm in the market complex 
the cons: 
1) Quality of Item sold in the market may vary from worst to good. 
2) Steep bargaining prowess needed. 
3) Beware of pick pockets

The lost art of negotiation thrives here.,TinaLouiseA,"London, United Kingdom",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,25-Aug-11,"We arrived in Kolkata and were told by our family and friends that live there that we were not allowed to shop without their assistance. After shopping with them a couple of times I realized I was totally capable of bartering so my husband, three kids and myself headed off to New Market on foot from the Oberoi Grand. We had a wonderful time! I found a booth that had silk clothing and sat on a stool, they measured us, brought us chai and bottled water (seal intact) and we piled up the shirts, pants and accessories for the five of us. When it came time to do the deal and our choices were made I let them throw out a number and then I went down seventy percent and held my ground until meeting them at about forty percent of the price they gave me. I think it is a fun experience and great for the kids to see how that works. One tip, the clothes are fine and come with the minimum of stiches so they can be altered. Have your seamstress or tailor reinforce the stitches before you wear the clothes or the seams come apart. We found some local textiles in the style of West Bengal and again, bartered with the kind shopkeeper until we had a price we thought was fair.

Where you get everything from pins to pachyderms.,Iftekhar A,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,3-Aug-11,"New Market is one of the most amazing shopping places of the world. Not so much for tourists as for locals as it can get days for one to familiarize oneself with the various departments. And dealing with the shopkeepers there is an art that few ever acquire. 
While I am completely blown away by the antiquity and the sprawl of the market my wife takes to it like fish to sea and knows each and every corner like the back of her hand. 

Built for Europeans only as in the markets before this the white people had to mix with Indians and that didn't go down very well with the arrogant colonizers. Along came a grand structure named after the chairman of the Municipal Corporation Sir Stuart Hogg. 

Since it's been referred as the New Market and is probably the world's oldest 'New' market. 

For western travelers its best to hire a porter and ask him to keep quiet. You may pay him INR 50 at the end just to keep quiet and to keep all the other porters away while you take the length and breadth of this enormous market at your own pace.

"Westerner, look out!",Nanckauf,chicago,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,25-Aug-10,"I have to agree with the reviewer before me who dubbed New Market his worst experience in Kolkata. The touts are all over you and there's no getting rid of them, unless one seeks refuge in one of the shop inside, where you are safe and unmolested. 
Two ways around this are 1) speed up and look stern and like you know exactly where you're going; 2) go with another Indian who will know better how to fend them off--I did twice and it made a big difference. 

I went there alone for some fabric and couldn't even relax enough to browse to get what I wanted. This is unfortunate because the place is crammed with interesting merchandise. I gave this place several tries on my own and each time left frustrated! 

Please, you westerners who go there: you only make things worse for the rest of us if you go in with a big camera swinging and respond to the touts. One pay-off in a hundred only serves to egg them on. More",
New Market was my worst experience in India,MikeMe,"Fort Lauderdale, Florida",ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,22-Dec-09,"In November of 2009 a friend and I took an afternoon off from site-seeing in Kolkata to visit the New Market to do some shopping. It was a big mistake. We didn't actually have much of an opportunity to do any shopping because we were pestered mercilessly by individuals who wanted to ""help us"" shop. As it turns out these individuals were herders who are paid commissions by shop owners to bring business to their shops. I explained over and over that we didn't need or want any assistance and that we wanted to be left alone. This didn't help. The pesting increased. My friend and I couldn't even have a normal conversation because of the pestering and ended up fleeing the market entirely. I would not recommend New Market to anyone. More",
A unique market,FootlooseIndian,"Kolkata, India",ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,22-Jan-08,"New Market or Sir Stuart Hogg Market as it is officially called has a charm of it's own.

Also, this is probably the only place in India where you can get uniquely British stuff such as barley sugar - and dirt cheap. It is also the only place in Calcutta I know of where you can still get Bandel cheese - a smoked Indian (or would Anglo-Indian be a better adjective?) cheese - which in itself tells a lot as Indians traditionally really go for cottage cheese, but not cheese.

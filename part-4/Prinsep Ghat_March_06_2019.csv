I say somewhat as though the structure is painted and maintained and well lit to make it attractive from a distance, you will find it to be dirty from close quarters. Like many other monuments in Kolkata, this place also needs a lot of daily-maintenance. The adjacent area has a lot of greenery and maintained pretty well (the Princep Ghat circular rail station is also pretty picturesque). The walkway and benches all along the river side are well though out and a good place for a walk or just to spend some time and enjoy the nature. The 'ghat' itself is cleaner than the others (as bathing and idol immersion are prohibited here) and a good place to sit for sometime and enjoy the beauty of the river Hoogly. More",Jan-18

Highly recommend as a nice slice of Kolkata life. Trees shade most of the promenade with great views of the bridge and passing boats as well as the occasional train rumbling down the tracks. Benches are many but are hard to come by as they are always (at least at dusk on the weekends) occupied by young lovebirds. People watching is fantastic and photo opportunities are varied and many. 

Do walk north toward the Howrah Bridge. You can sample delicious and cheap Kolkata street food such as phuchkas, paw bhaji, papri chat, jal muri and more! Then you can go into Scoop for ice cream and great views from the first floor. 

Best time to go is just before dusk. Wear comfortable walking shoes and bring an umbrella in case of passing showers. You can also take one of the many boats up and down the river (prices seem to be INR300 for 30 mins) for nice sunset views if you can't score a bench.

It's important to specify this in advance else there might be other options in store for you which shocked the life out of me.

The structure in the middle has terrific lighting,and when the lights are lit in the early evening,it looks fabulous. The ground is almost devoid of green grass,and should have been better maintained. The litter boxes are full of spit-marks and looks downright dirty. 
There is a family of elephants (made by moss over some permanent structure) which attracts both children and 'selfie' takers !

What saddens me is that Kolkata does have some amazing places but thanks to some of the people and their vandalism that such places get destroyed. The James Princep Memorial with the Vidyasagar Setu in it's backdrop is every budding photographer's delight .............yet, some vandals have managed to destroy it by spray painting filth on one part of the structure.

Double Standard,PORhibido,Krungthep Mahanakorn,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,27-Mar-13,"Built during the colonial era, this ghat overlooking Vidyasagar Setu (Second Hooghly Bridge) is an oasis of calm now popular among lovers. We saw one couple taking photos of one another there but when we aimed at the Memorial (with the Bridge in the background) from afar, the security guard shouted at us ""no, no"" perhaps because he wanted us to pay him ""photo permission fee."" When we pointed at the couple, the guard just pretended not to speak any English. We then walked towards the jetty; the sunset was stunning but the ghat itself was nothing to write home about.",Nov-12

Witness the otherside of Kolkata---,Avik_22,Kolkata,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,6-Feb-13,"Princep Ghats is best visited in early morning and during sunset, the riverside lane, with the Chakra Rail is an absolute bliss encircling the same, in a highly chaotic daily life. In the evening the lights of the Vidyasagar Setu goes and and , its best that you take a boat ride just before sunrise and witness the magical transformation.

An evening by the River Hooghly,The_Nath_Family,"Atlanta, Georgia",ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,28-Jun-12,"This memorial structure on the banks of the Hooghly River is dedicated to James Princep (scholar and antiquary).

Very peaceful,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,30-May-18,"This was my 3rd visit to Darjeeling since 2004 and the first thing we do there is offer our prayers to Mahakal Temple. I was with my wife and 2 kids (6 years and 1.5 years). The passage to temple start from famous Darjeeling Mall area and its a 10 mins walk uphill. We are not habituated with such uphill walk but some how we managed. The real surprise was my little daughter - she walk almost all the way from our Hotel till the temple... quite an achievement for someone so young. My elder one was all full of energy and was running uphill and downhill all the time - he was not at all tired. 

We were late and it was lunch time for almost all locals - so the temple was not at all crowded. Shops were closed so we could not buy flowers or sweets for the offerings. However the priests helped us with the flowers and sweets and asked us to offer them to the deity. Around 10 mins - for prayer and rest of the time my kids were enjoying walking on the temple premises. Ringing bells with my help. 

There are monkeys in and around the temple so you need to be careful as they could snatch things/bags from you while looking for food items.

The gateway is in the west side of the Mall Road, with a distinct signboard and we had seen people climbing up and down from the path leading to the temple. It was early in the morning and a peaceful stroll through the Mall Road from East Side brought us in front of the gate. Suddenly it struck me that why not take a look and so we started climbing up casually. No one was in view to ask for the direction or distance or climb. Thankfully it is a single track road. The climb, can not be measured with eyes and distance but felt in the limb and chest. Panting and Puffing we reached at last our tongue almost sticking out. Reaching there we were a little surprised. It is supposed to be a Hindu temple, because as per my knowledge, Mahakal is one of the name of Lord Shiva. But it looks like a Budhha shrine, with all its coloured flags etc. with prayer wheels encircling the main sanctum of Mahakal. For whom the bell tolls, it is obviously a happy sight, observing both faith simultaneously, without disturbing each other. This is perhaps the topmost point in Darjeeling town, and the scenic beauty surrounding... We have walked past the Mahakal Temple quite a few times while walking down to the Mall but it never stuck me to visit the Mahakal Temple, situated on the top of the mall. The gateway is in the west side of the Mall Road, with a distinct signboard and we had seen people climbing up and down from the path leading to the temple.

For whom the bell tolls, it is obviously a happy sight, observing both faith simultaneously, without disturbing each other. This is perhaps the topmost point in Darjeeling town, and the scenic beauty surrounding it is divine, calm and peaceful. There are several more deities like Mother Kali, Mahaveer Hanuman, Sainnath etc. This is a place where all the faith coexist together peacefully . More",Oct-16

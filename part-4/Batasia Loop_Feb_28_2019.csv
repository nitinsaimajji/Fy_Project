Dreadful,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,19-Nov-18,"This is a stop on the incredibly disappointing 'toy' train. There is nothing of interest here and the view is often obscured by mist, pollution or both. Of course, the pollution is partially created by the train itself which belches smoke as it carts tourists around at ripoff prices. Avoid unless you're really desperate to find something to do in Darjeeling (which you might be!)",Nov-18
Waste of time,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,15-Nov-18,I got taken to this as part of a tour after seeing the sun rise on Tiger Hill. It was not worth the time or the 20 rupee entry fee.

Crowded and over commercialised,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_20,6-Nov-18,"What it's supposed to be: A combination of a gorkha memorial, garden, and a binocular view point of the city and hills. 

What it's become - a too-convenient touch point for all tourists returning from Tiger Hill Sunrise. Too many vendors hawking their wares , too many ""binocular guides"" offering to show all the sights on a foggy morning.. an unplanned garden..and thronging with tourists trying to take selfies in a crowded place.. not a memorable experience for me.",Nov-18

A lush green toy train pathway,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,18-Oct-18,"Perhaps one of the most picturesque train routes in all of Darjeeling, the Batasia Loop is a lush green toy train pathway that is meant to minimise the elevation of the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway. The unique design of this magnificent attraction allows the track to wrap around itself through a hilltop tunnel. One of the most enchanting aspects of the Batasia Loop is its unmatched natural beauty which is a wonderful sight to behold. Located on Hill Cart Road (NH 55), you can enjoy a panoramic view of the Darjeeling in all its verdant glory. 
Situated in Ghum which is about 5 kilometres from Darjeeling, the Batasia Loop was commissioned for construction in the year 1919. A memorial dedicated to the Gorkha soldiers of the Indian Army who laid down their lives during the war of Indian independence is situated close by as well. Batasia Loop rises from the midst of emerald carpets of mountain vegetation and overlooks the snowy peaks of Kanchenjungha on one side as well. Endearing flowers line the way, which makes a trip through this attraction a must after you have witnessed the fascinating sunrise of Tiger Hill.

A different Batasia Loop amidst mist,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,16-Sep-18,"We had been to this place many a times but not by the Toy Train.

These trains have 1st class only and rates are as far as I remember Rs 1300/- for Steam drives and and a little less about Rs 900/- for Diesel driven engines. Since this only 8-10 Km journey ( about 20 KM both ways) drills hole in pockets, I prefer to go to Batasia Loop by taxi . 

This well maintained place is excellent in a sunny day but in a cloudy day this is beautiful too. 

There are plenty of eateries in Batasia Loop area and one can pass good time here woth friends or family.

Deja vu,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,3-Jul-18,"Hving seen millions of snaps already, it is a bit of a deja vu. Best done by the DHR. Stay within the complex as outside etc is not very well maintained. During monsoons, the view consisted only of clouds so the basic of the loop doesn't come across. 
The DHR tho is worth every penny.",Jun-18

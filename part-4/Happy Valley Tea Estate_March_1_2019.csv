Teaaaa,cooker3000,"Dublin, Ireland",ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,6-Feb-19,"There was no way I was going to visit Darjeeling and not visit a tea plantation. There is a bunch of them but this is by far the most centrally located. It's a comfortable 20-30 minute from Darjeeling. They do tours once an hour depending on numbers. The tour guide was fine although basically stuck to her script but I did learn some of the vines they use are there over a century! At the end naturally there is tasting and you can buy some tea if you like it 
They allow you to walk around the grounds which makes for some nice pictures. All of this for 100 rupees. More",Oct-18

Learnt lots about tea,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,15-Nov-18,"The guided tour of the estate was really interesting. Got to learn lots about how tea is grown and made. There’s also a quick tasting at the end where you learn how to taste tea properly and get to try about six different varieties. 

Plus, the shop sells tea at a slightly cheaper price than you can get in the shops in Darjeeling. You can also wander around one of the tea fields on your own. More",Nov-18
Pathetic Place.,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_10,4-Nov-18,"The Happy Valley Tea Estate/ factory Darjeeling provides free shuttle to their estate from 9:00 Am till 4:00 PM. 
We, a family of 3 boarded the shuttle Sharp at 4 P.m. on 1st Nov, 18 and reached there by around 4-20 PM or so. 
To our surprise, after charging us the entry fee of Rs.100 per person, we were told that factory shuts at 4:00. I didn't understand, if they shut at 4:00 PM, why do they have the 4:00 PM shuttle time slot. We were taken around the factory to show machines which were shut and had no electricity in the work area. Was a sheer waste of time. 
What was more surprising was, at around 04:55 PM the driver of the shuttle (A Van) started shouting at us that we don't leave in 5 min he would leave us there only and we will have to walk down 15 kms. Can u imagine that, a tourist family left all alone in the jungle, stranded???? 
Though after an arguement, the driver dropped us back, though he was in no mood to do so. When asked his name, he just rudely drove off. 
Called the number of the tea factory to inform about the same, but not much of use. 
Certainely can be avoided. Wasted time and got humiliated by the driver.. More",Nov-18
Underwealming,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,4-Nov-18,"Whilst the tea estate looked beautiful the experience that I took back about the tour of the factory was underwhelming. 

The factory was not very well maintained. They could’ve been much better posters and information posted and the tour was a quick 20 minutes through the factory and the tea making process without any tour on the actual estate - which was off limits! 

Also they wouldn’t allow you to photograph anything - it’s a tea factory not a nuclear facility! Get over it people! 

Taking back some memories is the whole point to visiting such places but again Incredible !ndia shows you that it’s not that incredible! More",Nov-18
The second oldest tea estate in the tea-rich town of Darjeeling,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,19-Oct-18,"At a magical altitude of 6,800 feet, the Happy Valley Tea Estate is a fine land expanse of about 437 acres, growing some of the finest shrubs of this delightful drink in the world. It is the second oldest tea estate in the tea-rich town of Darjeeling, with its origins being closely connected to the history of cultivating and producing the world-famous Darjeeling Tea. The endless expanse of lush plantations situated on a hilly slope combines well with the captivating aroma ensuing from within, mesmerising travellers as they are treated to the charming nuances of producing tea. 
At this verdant wonderland, the respect for nature is evident through the use of organic and biodynamic methods of farming. One can take a guided tour through the fragrant factory, observing how fresh tea leaves are withered, rolled, fermented, dried, sorted and finally graded to produce the different varieties of tea we see in the market, from traditional black tea and green tea to more exquisite speciality teas like Super Fine Tippy Golden Flowery Orange Pekoe. Also known as Black Orthodox Tea, this is one of the finest tea blends of India which is enjoyed across the world. A tea-tasting session is also held, where first-timers are privy to experiencing the subtleties involved in distinguishing the various groups of tea.

Enjoyable tea estate tour.,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,25-May-18,"Happy valley tea estates: We had a great visit to this estate, the smallest of the 87 tea estates in Darjeeling. The visit if quite brief, consisting of the history of the place with some demonstrations of old tea making methods. You can observe some of the manufacturing that takes place here, from an elevated gantry. Visits are guide led and take place every 20mins or so, very informative, we just turned up and waited a short time for it to begin. Beware the walk from the main road to the estate entrance is steep and a little challenging, also you can take a car down but this is also a little treacherous. Similar to many roads in Darjeeling.

There is also an excellent, small shop at the end of the tour where you can taste varieties of Darjeeling tea and then make a purchase of you wish. More",May-18

Nice educational trip,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,18-May-18,"Nice place to visit and see how it's done.

Learned that original tea plants came from China and are many decades old. 

Found pruning methods interesting and implements used. Pruning mostly men's work. 

Picking mostly women's work. 

Fascinating building which you felt pulsates with action , on a working day. 

The road to Happy Valley Estate, by truck or jeep is not for this faint hearted. 

Chance to buy top quality tea at the end of visit. 

About 45 minutes ro 1 hour,

Don't go out your way,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,10-Mar-18,"We spent 1-2 hours touring the factory and grounds and trying the tea.

Amazing experience!,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,12-Feb-18,"Honestly speaking, we were just walking around aimlessly in Darjeeling when we chanced upon this tea estate. Decided to walk up to the factory for a tour which was mentioned on internet. It was a bit disheartening to know that there is no production in January so the factory was closed. However, the guided tour (basically a detailed lecture) made our day. It was very detailed, with our guide more than happy to answer questions. The tour was expected to last45 minutes but took over 90 minutes due to questions from everyone. Overall this was great experience to learn about tea and it was topped off with tea tasting giving nice overview of different types of teas. Do visit after March to see the action taking place.

"A beautiful view, the gardens are incredible, the staff are friendly. The tea is great!",,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,15-Aug-17,"HOWEVER, 
Do not buy the tea from the factory if you want black tea, The factory shop gives you a wonderful array of their best teas for tasting. It surely is the top grade tea they produce, however what you buy behind the counter (conveniently named the same) is not the tea you just tasted. There are various grades of tea, The tea you buy in the tins/sacks here isn't that cheap and its the low grade tea. It tastes okay, but don't expect it to be anything like the tasting array. 

All the highest grade tea (SFTGFOP-1 is the grade) is most likely sold to external buyers. 

Just thought i'd save you all a few rupees. 

THAT SAID, 

The tea estate is a beautiful location, we had a wonderful chat with one of the managers there ( I think he was in charge of the tea pickers ) and he explained the processes to us, and his job role. We saw the pickers go about their daily work, and tasted some wonderful tea. The factory production line was explained by a tour guide who was also very good, and it was great to really see how the tea we drink back at home is made. More",Apr-17

Interesting tour and beautiful estate.,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,1-Jun-17,"The tour is very basic. The guide could explain the difference between Darjeeling and Assam teas, which was interesting, but she clearly was not a tea expert in general, so you might feel frustrated if you have a lot of questions. 
Try to avoid Sundays and Mondays as there is no work on Sundays, and as there is no leaf picking on Sundays, there is no machining on Mondays, so you will be able to see only switched off machines... Still worth it if you have never been in a tea plantation and have no other day available. 
There was a tea tasting at the end, but nothing so amazing for tea lovers who have tasted a lot of teas. 
I loved the view on the estate with the mountains and the city as background. Great view from the top road!! More",Apr-17

Introduction into tea,,,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,22-May-17,"Happy tea valley is very easy to reach with the free ride departing from uptown near Nehru park. The minibus leaves at 9:30, 10:45, 12:00,1:30,2:45 and 4pm and will drop you back at the same point. 
The ride is free but the tour will cost you 100rupees per person and will include a tea tasting and a tour with a full explanation of the factory and the different processes that the Darjeeling tea undergoes in order to become the fragrant black tea, or healthy green and white tea. The guides are very friendly and will answer all your questions. There is no pressure to buy but knowing that 95% of their production is exported to the hands of the monopoly of England, Germany and Japan; makes it a good reason to buy locally from the 5% remaining. The tea comes form a fully organic production. The Valley allows you to have a tour around the crops and enjoy the view from the hills if you are lucky to have a day without fog. It is a nice thing to do with friends but also with your family! More",May-17
